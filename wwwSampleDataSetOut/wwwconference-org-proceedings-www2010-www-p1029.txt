ABSTRACT 
With the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as 
tour  guide  and  location-based  social  network,  we  now  have 
accumulated  many  location  data  on  the  Web.  In  this  paper,  we 
show  that,  by  using  the  location  data  based  on  GPS  and  users’ 
comments  at  various  locations,  we  can  discover  interesting 
locations  and  possible  activities  that  can  be  performed  there  for 
recommendations.  Our  research  is  highlighted  in  the  following 
location-related  queries  in  our  daily  life:  1)  if  we  want  to  do 
something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such 
as  Beijing,  where  should  we  go?  2)  If  we  have  already  visited 
some places such as the Bird’s Nest building in Beijing’s Olympic 
park, what else can we do there? By using our system, for the first 
question,  we  can  recommend  her  to  visit  a  list  of  interesting 
locations  such  as  Tiananmen  Square,  Bird’s  Nest,  etc.  For  the 
second question, if the user visits Bird’s Nest, we can recommend 
her to not only do sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor 
exercise  facilities  or  try  some  nice food  nearby.  To  achieve this 
goal, we first model the users’ location and activity histories that 
we take as input. We then mine knowledge, such as the location 
features  and  activity-activity  correlations  from  the  geographical 
databases  and  the  Web,  to  gather  additional  inputs.  Finally,  we 
apply a collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting 
locations and activities, and use them to recommend to the users 
where  they  can  visit  if  they  want  to  perform  some  specific 
activities and what they can do if they visit some specific places. 
We  empirically  evaluated  our  system  using  a  large  GPS  dataset 
collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. 
We extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system 
can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As  the  mobile  devices  with  positioning  function,  such  as  GPS-
phones, become more and more popular, people now are able to 
know their locations easily. Based on these location data, various 
location-based services are provided on the Web and shown to be

quite  attractive  to  the  users.  For  example,  a  bunch  of  outdoor 
sports forums have emerged to provide various geo-related Web 
services [1][2][20]. By using these services, the forum users can 
upload  and  share  their  outdoor  sports  (such  as  bicycle  riding) 
trajectories  with  other  users.  In  this  way,  they  can  conveniently 
manage their own outdoor sports trajectories and also share them 
with other outdoor sports fans. In addition, thanks to some Web-
based location data management services [7], the users can now 
share on Web not only their raw GPS trajectories with coordinates 
and time stamps, but also comments denoting what the user did, 
what  she  saw  and/or  how  she  felt  on  some  locations.  Figure  1 
gives an example of such a GPS data management system: a user 
uploaded a GPS trajectory to Forbidden City area in Beijing, and 
he  also  attached  some  comments  (depicted  as  small  pink  boxes, 
each unfolded as a text box) about how he felt about the places. 
Such comments bring more semantics to the GPS trajectories, and 
make  it  easier  for  GPS  users  to  share  their  travel  experiences. 
Beyond directly sharing the GPS trajectories, we can also better 
understand the location trajectories by mining knowledge from the 
users’ location trajectories. In this way, we are capable to provide 
more interesting location-based services, including transportation 
routine  prediction  [3][4],  location-based  activity  recognition  [5] 
and location-based social network [6,22].

In  this  paper,  we  aim  to  mine  more  knowledge  from  the  GPS 
location data, so that we can answer two typical questions that we 
often  ask  in  our  daily:  1)  if  we  want  to  do  something  such  as 
sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing, where 
should we go? 2) If we have already visited some places such as 
the Bird’s Nest building in Beijing’s Olympic park, what else can 
we do there? In general, the first question corresponds to location 
recommendation given some activity query (where “activity” can 
refer to various human behaviors such as food-hunting, shopping, 
watching movies/shows, enjoying sports/exercises, tourism, etc.), 
and the second question corresponds to activity recommendation 

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1029given  some  location  query.  By  answering  these  two  typical 
questions, we can satisfy many information needs for the users in 
both their daily routines and trip planning. We show to put both 
location recommendation and activity recommendation together in 
our  knowledge  mining,  since  locations  and  activities  are  closely 
related in nature. Specifically, to model the relationship between 
the  locations  and  the  activities,  we  can  construct  a  location-
activity  matrix  (details  are  given  in  Section  3.2),  whose  rows 
denote the locations and columns denote the activities. Each entry 
in this location-activity matrix is a rating showing how often an 
activity is performed in a location. Therefore, as shown in Figure 
2, we can see location recommendation given some activity query 
as  ranking  over  the  rows  given  some  column,  and  activity 
recommendation as ranking over the columns given some row.

However, it is not easy to obtain such a complete location-activity 
matrix  for  location  and  activity  recommendations  from  the  raw 
GPS  data  due  to  the  following  reasons:  1)  the  ratings  in  such  a 
location-activity matrix are not easy to get from the raw GPS data 
with  merely  location  coordinates  and  timestamps.  Recall  that  a 
rating in the matrix denotes how often an activity is performed in 
a location, so we may need to know what each user did on that 
location  to  get  a  rating.  But  the  raw  GPS  data  may  not  convey 
such information, and we have to find another way. We propose 
to  use  the  possibly  available  comments  provided  by  the  users, 
which indicate what the user did on some locations, as shown in 
Figure  1.  But  unfortunately,  in  practice  the  users  usually  do  not 
provide  many  comments.  For  example,  in  our  dataset  which  is 
collected  from  a  Web-based  GPS  data  management  service  for 
over  2.5  years,  we  have  12,765  GPS  trajectories,  but  only  530 
comments and many of them were attached to some same popular 
locations.  It  means,  many  locations  do  not  have  any  comments 
attached  to  them,  so  when  we  try  to  get  the  ratings  from  these 
comments,  we may  have  many  missing  entries  in  the  matrix. 2) 
Based  on  the  previous  reason,  we  can  only  get  a  very  sparse 
location-activity  matrix  (e.g.  in  our  dataset,  we  have  less  than 
0.6%  entries  with  non-missing  values),  so  it  is  difficult  to  do 
recommendations  with  such  limited  information.  We  suggest 
exploiting  other  additional  information  on  the  locations  and 
activities, and use it to alleviate the data sparsity. However, what 
kind of information we should extract? How we can incorporate it 
with  the  location-activity  matrix  to  do  recommendations?  These 
are non-trivial questions.  
In  this  paper,  based  on  the  GPS  history  data,  including  location 
information (i.e. coordinates and timestamps) and some available 
user comments, we develop a system to provide both location and 
activity  recommendations.  We  achieve  this  goal  by  exploiting 
various  useful  information  sources,  i.e.  meaningful  location 
features  and  activity-activity  correlations,  and  using  them  by 
collaborative  filtering  with  the  sparse  location-activity  matrix  to 
do  recommendations.  Our  collaborative  location  and  activity 
recommendation  (CLAR)  model  is  based  on  collective  matrix 
factorization  to  propagate  information  among  the  two  additional 
information  sources  and  the  sparse  location-activity  matrix,  so 

that  we  can  collaboratively  predict  the  missing  entries  in  the 
location-activity matrix for recommendations. Our work is a step 
towards  associating  the  locations  and  the  activities  to  boost  the 
location-based  services  on  the  Web  by  using  mobile  data.  The 
contributions of this paper lie in three aspects: 
•  We  put  forward  a  new  problem  for  collaborative  location 
and  activity  recommendations  based  on  the  GPS  history 
data, so that we can provide more specific recommendations 
with location or activity constraints. 

•  We propose to exploit location features and activity-activity 
correlations  for collaborative  filtering,  so  as  to  address  the 
data  sparsity  problem  of  the  GPS  histories.  We  also  show 
how to well incorporate this additional information with the 
incomplete  location-activity  matrix  in  a  collective  matrix 
factorization model for final recommendations. 

•  We  evaluate  our  system  using  a  large  GPS  dataset,  which 
was collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 year in the 
real world. The number of GPS points is around 4 million 
and its total distance was over 139,310 kilometers. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
gives  an  overview  of  our  system.  Section  3  introduces  the  data 
modeling for location-activity matrix generation, location feature 
and  activity-activity  correlation  extraction.  Section  4  details  our 
collaborative filtering model which takes the previous three pieces 
of information as inputs. In Section 5, we report the experimental 
results  and  offer  some  discussions.  In  Section  6,  we  survey  the 
related works. In Section 7, we draw our conclusions and present 
the future work.  
2.  OVERVIEW OF OUR SYSTEM 
In  this  section,  we  first  clarify  some  terms  used  in  this  paper. 
Then,  we  briefly  introduce  the  architecture  of  our  system  and 
demonstrate the application scenarios of our system. 
2.1  Preliminary 
First, we will clarify some terms, including GPS trajectory (Traj), 
stay point (s) and stay region (r). 
Definition  1.  GPS  trajectory:  A  user’s  trajectory  Traj  is  a 

sequence of time-stamped points: (cid:1846)(cid:1870)(cid:1853)(cid:1862)=〈(cid:1868)(cid:2868),(cid:1868)(cid:2869),…,(cid:1868)(cid:3038)〉, where a 
GPS  point (cid:1868)(cid:3036)=((cid:1876)(cid:3036),(cid:1877)(cid:3036),(cid:1872)(cid:3036)),∀0≤(cid:1861)<(cid:1863), with (cid:1872)(cid:3036)  as  a  timestamp 
((cid:1872)(cid:3036)<(cid:1872)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)), and ((cid:1876)(cid:3036),(cid:1877)(cid:3036)) as  the two-dimension  coordinates  [4].  In 

the right part of Figure 3, we show a trajectory consisted of 7 GPS 
points. 

Figure 3. GPS trajectory and stay point 

Definition 2. Stay point: A stay point s stands for a geographical 

region  where  a  user  stayed  over  a  time  threshold (cid:1846)(cid:3045)  within  a 
distance  threshold  of (cid:1830)(cid:3045) .  Denote (cid:1830)(cid:1861)(cid:1871)(cid:1872)(cid:3435)(cid:1868)(cid:3036),(cid:1868)(cid:3037)(cid:3439) as  the  geospatial 
distance between two points (cid:1868)(cid:3036) and (cid:1868)(cid:3037), and  (cid:1835)(cid:1866)(cid:1872)(cid:3435)(cid:1868)(cid:3036),(cid:1868)(cid:3037)(cid:3439)= (cid:3627)(cid:1868)(cid:3036).(cid:1872)(cid:3036)−
(cid:1868)(cid:3037).(cid:1872)(cid:3037)| as their time interval. In a user’s trajectory, s can be seen as 
(cid:1842)=〈(cid:1868)(cid:3040),(cid:1868)(cid:3040)(cid:2878)(cid:2869),…,(cid:1868)(cid:3041)〉 ,  where ∀(cid:1865)<(cid:1861)≤(cid:1866) , (cid:1830)(cid:1861)(cid:1871)(cid:1872)((cid:1868)(cid:3040),(cid:1868)(cid:3036))≤(cid:1830)(cid:3045), 
(cid:1830)(cid:1861)(cid:1871)(cid:1872)((cid:1868)(cid:3040),(cid:1868)(cid:3041)(cid:2878)(cid:2869))>(cid:1830)(cid:3045) and (cid:1835)(cid:1866)(cid:1872)((cid:1868)(cid:3040),(cid:1868)(cid:3041))≥(cid:1846)(cid:3045).  Hence,  a  stay  point

Compared with raw GPS points, stay points are more meaningful 
in  representing  the  locations  a  user  stays  by  capturing  the  time 
duration and vicinity information, and they are commonly used as 
the basic units in representing the GPS data [4][6]. However, in 
practice,  when  we  consider  many  GPS  trajectories  together,  we 
may find that some stay points refer to a same interested region. 
This is because the users can stay in different parts (e.g. the west 
and east wings) of an interested region (e.g. Bird’s Nest stadium). 
In recommendation, we focus on a whole interested region such as 
Bird’s Nest rather than its two wings, so we need to further extract 
some geographical region by clustering the nearby stay points. We 
call these regions as stay regions. 
Definition  3.  Stay  region  (location):  Given  all  the  stay  points 
extracted  from 
clustering  algorithm  Alg(S)  taking  S  as  input,  we  have  a  stay 
region r as a geographic region which contains a set of stay points 

the  GPS  data  as (cid:1845)={(cid:1871)(cid:2869),(cid:1871)(cid:2870),…,(cid:1871)(cid:3015)}  and  a 
(cid:1845)(cid:4593)={(cid:1871)(cid:4593)(cid:3040),(cid:1871)(cid:4593)(cid:3040)(cid:2878)(cid:2869),…,(cid:1871)(cid:4593)(cid:3041)|(cid:1871)′(cid:3036)∈(cid:1845),∀(cid:1865)≤(cid:1861)≤(cid:1866)} belonging to some 
same cluster. Hence, a stay region (cid:1870)=((cid:1876),(cid:1877)), where  
(cid:1870).(cid:1876)=∑

this  work,  stay  regions  are  used  as  the  basic  units  for  location 
recommendation,  i.e.  when  we  recommend  locations,  in  fact  we 
recommend stay regions. 
We instantiate Alg as a grid-based clustering algorithm as shown 
in Figure 6. Notice that we do not directly extract stay regions by 
clustering on the raw GPS points from all the trajectories. This is 
because  we  may  lose  the  sequential  information  by  mixing  the 
raw GPS points from different trajectories together, and thus it is 
hard to detect the meaningful stays. 
2.2  Application Scenarios 
The work reported in this paper is an important component of our 
GeoLife  project  [7],  whose  prototype  has  been 
internally 
accessible within Microsoft since Oct. 2007. So far, we have had 
162 individuals using this system.

Figure 4. User interface for our system 

Figure  4  shows  our  system’s  user  interface.  It’s  organized  as  a 
Website (similar to a search engine) so that both PCs and hand-
held  devices  can  access  it.  To  use  our  system,  for  example,  in 

 

activity  recommendation,  a  user  can  input  a  location,  such  as 
“Bird’s Nest”, as a location query; then, our system can show the 
queried location on the map and suggest a ranking list of activities 
(top  5  here).  The  user  can  provide  some  feedbacks  about  the 
results by giving some ratings. For location recommendation, the 
user can input an activity, such as “tourism and amusement”, as 
an  activity  query;  then  our  system  can  suggest  a  ranking  list  of 
candidate locations (top 10 here) and display them on the map, so 
that the user can zoom in on the map and get more details (e.g. 
transportations).  The  user  can  also  view  the  location  candidates 
ranked lower than 10 to get more recommendations. Similarly, the 
user can also provide feedbacks on location recommendation. 
2.3  Architecture 
We demonstrate our system’s architecture in Figure 5. Our system 
consists  of  6  parts, including  data  inputs,  stay  region  extraction, 
location-activity 
feature 
extraction,  activity-activity  correlation  mining  and  collaborative 
location  and  activity  recommendations.  In  the  first  5  parts,  we 
model  the  data  and  extract  knowledge  as  inputs  to  train  a 
recommendation system. This process can be performed off-line. 
In  real-time  (for  part  6),  the  users  can  access  the  recommender 
through  internet  using  laptops/PCs  or  PDAs/smart-phones,  and 
submit the query (i.e. activity or location names). Our system will 
then  return  a  ranking  list  of  locations  or  activities  given  the 
activity or location query.

Data inputs: In addition to the users’ GPS trajectories with some 
comments, our system also exploits various information sources, 
including  Point-of-Interest  (POI)  category  database  and  World 
Wide Web, to alleviate the data sparsity problem that occurs when 
there are few comments to get reliable statistics of the location-
activity relations. We will give more details about using these two 
information sources in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.  
Stay region extraction: As the stay points sometimes may refer to 
some common locations, we extract stay regions by clustering the 
stay  points  and  use  them  for  location  recommendations.  Notice 
that in practice, the recommended locations are supposed to have 
limited region sizes, so we take this constraint into consideration 
and propose a grid-based clustering algorithm to extract the stay 
regions. More details are in Section 3.1. 
Location-activity information extraction: With the available user 
comments to the GPS trajectories, we can get the statistics about 
what kinds of activities the users performed on some location, and 
how  often  they  performed  these  activities.  By  organizing  this 
statistics’ data in a matrix form, we can have a location-activity 

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1031matrix, with rows as locations and columns as activities. An entry 
in the matrix denotes the frequency for the users to perform some 
activity on some location. We will give the details in Section 3.2 
to  show  how  to  get  these  entries.  Note  that,  due  to  the  limited 
amount  of  comments,  the  obtained  location-activity  matrix  is 
quite sparse. Our ultimate objective is to appropriately fill all the 
missing entries in that matrix, so that we can rank all the entries 
for collaborative location and activity recommendation. 
Location feature extraction: We exploit the location features with 
the help of POI category database. The database is based on the 
city yellow pages, and it can provide us the knowledge that what 
kinds of POIs we have in an area. For example, by query the POI 
category  database  with  some  location  area,  we  can  know  how 
many restaurants (and theaters, museums, etc.) exist in this area. 
This helps us to get some sense of this location’s functionalities, 
so that we can use them as features for better recommendations. 
Similarly, by organizing the data in a matrix form, we can have a 
location-feature  matrix,  with  rows  as  locations  and  columns  as 
features. Each entry of the matrix denotes some feature value on 
that location. We give more details in Section 3.3. 
Activity-activity correlation mining: We exploit the World Wide 
Web,  to  get  the  knowledge  about  the  activity  correlations.  With 
this knowledge, we may better infer that if a user performs some 
activity on a location, then it is likely that she will also perform 
another activity. For example, when the users go to see a movie in 
some place, it is quite likely they will also have some foods/drinks 
there.  One  possible  way  to  get  such  activity-activity  correlation 
information  is  directly  having  some  statistics  over  the  activity 
occurrence in the GPS data; however, as the amount of available 
comments is few, we may not get reliable statistics. Therefore, we 
refer to the World Wide Web, which is a huge knowledge source, 
to get such statistics. By organizing the data in a matrix form, we 
have  an  activity-activity  matrix,  with  rows  and  columns  both  as 
activities.  Each  entry  of  the  matrix  denotes  the  correlation 
between a pair of activities. We give more details in Section 3.4. 
Collaborative location and activity recommendations: Having the 
knowledge of location-activity matrix, location-feature matrix and 
activity-activity  correlation  matrix,  we  can  train  a  recommender 
system.  We  propose  a  collaborative  filtering  model  under  the 
collective matrix factorization framework [11], and manage to fill 
the  missing  entries  in  the  location-activity  matrix.  Based  on  the 
filled location-activity matrix, we will rank and retrieve the top k 
locations/activities for recommendations to the users who access 
our system by PCs/PDAs. More details are given in Section 4.  
3.  DATA MODELING 
In this section, we will introduce how to model the data in order to 
obtain  the  location-activity,  location-feature  and  activity-activity 
matrices as inputs for training the recommender.  
3.1  Stay Region Extraction 
In practice, the recommended locations should not be too large in 
size;  otherwise,  the  user  may  not  easily  find  the  true  interesting 
locations in a large area. As a result, when we consider clustering 
the stay points to get stay regions, we need to take such a limit 
into  account.  Previous  clustering  algorithms  used  in  GPS  data 
processing, such as the classic k-means algorithm and the density-
based  OPTICS  clustering  algorithm  [19],  do  not  constrain  the 
output  cluster  sizes.  So  we  propose  a  new  grid-based  clustering 
algorithm, as described in Figure 6.  

The  basic  idea  is  as  follows.  First,  let’s  denote (cid:1847)={(cid:1873)(cid:1863),1≤(cid:1863)≤
|(cid:1847)|} as  a  set  of  users.  For  each  user (cid:1873)(cid:3038)∈(cid:1847),  we  parse  her  GPS

trajectory by seeking some spatial regions where (cid:1873)(cid:3038) spent a period 
over a certain threshold (cid:1846)(cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046)(cid:3035) and the distance between any two 
consecutive GPS points in it is less than (cid:1830)(cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046)(cid:3035). For more details, 
algorithm, we have a stay point set (cid:1845)(cid:1842)={(cid:1845)(cid:3038),1≤(cid:1863)≤|(cid:1847)|} where 
each (cid:1845)(cid:3038)={(cid:1871)(cid:2869),(cid:1871)(cid:2870),…,(cid:1871)(cid:3015)} is the stay point set for user (cid:1873)(cid:3038).

grid (cid:1859)(cid:3036) that  is  unassigned  to  any  stay  region  yet  and  has  the 
maximal number of stay points |(cid:1859)(cid:3036).(cid:1871)(cid:1868)|. Then, we will extract its 8 
neighboring  grids  (i.e.  consider  a  square  shape  with 3×3 grids 
and (cid:1859)(cid:3036)  in  the  center).  The  unassigned  grids  among  these  8 
neighboring grids, denoted as (cid:1866)(cid:1859), are clustered with (cid:1859)(cid:3036) to form a 
new stay region (cid:1870)=(cid:1859)(cid:3036)∪(cid:1866)(cid:1859). Hence, all the stay points in (cid:1859)(cid:3036) and 
(cid:1866)(cid:1859) are clustered into the stay region (cid:1870). Note that at most there will 
be 3×3 grids clustered to a stay region, so we can constrain the 
extracted  stay  region  size  as (cid:1856)×(cid:1856) .  Finally,  we  calculate  the 
in (cid:1870) as (cid:1870)’s coordinates. At last, we output a set of stay regions R. 
from the stay points. For each stay region (cid:1870)(cid:3036) in the stay region set 
(cid:1844)={(cid:1870)(cid:3036),1≤(cid:1861)≤(cid:1865)}, we can first extract the comments from the 

3.2  Location-Activity Information Extraction 
Based on stay region extraction, we can get a set of stay regions 

Third,  we  employ  a  greedy  strategy  to  cluster  grids  (containing 
stay points). At each round (steps 8-15), we start with finding a

Second,  we  divide  the  map  into  grids  (step  4),  in  order  to 
constrain our output stay region to be limited in size. In particular,

project  all  the  detected  stay  points  in  these  grids  (steps  5-6),  so 

centroids of all the stay points’ latitude and longitude coordinates 

GPS data that attached to this stay region. After that, we parse the 
comments,  which  in  general  are  texts,  to  get  the  activities.  For 
example, if a comment mentions “delicious” or “restaurant”, then 
it implies that the user had some foods or drinks at this location. 
Hence,  we  can  have  an  activity  of  “food  and  drink”  on  this 
location. By parsing all the comments, we can get the counts of 
various activities on each stay region (location). Specifically, for a 

location  i,  we  can  have  an  n-dimensional  count  vector (cid:2185)(cid:3036)=
[(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:2869),(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:2870),…,(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)] for  n  activities,  where  each (cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:3037) is  the  number  of

can define its entries as: 

times  when  activity  j  performed  at  location  i  according  to  the 

comments. Denote the location-activity matrix as (cid:1850)(cid:3040)×(cid:3041); then we 
matrix X are zeros. However, when (cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)=0, it doesn’t mean that 

(2) 
Note  that  some  locations  may  not  have  any  comments,  so  their 
count vectors are zero vectors and the corresponding entries in the 

(cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)=(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:3037),∀(cid:1861)=1,…,(cid:1865); (cid:1862)=1,…,(cid:1866) 

there is no possibility to perform activity j at location i. It is just 
because there is no comment that records that activity. So we treat 
all these entries equal to 0 as missing values for predictions.  
3.3  Location-Feature Extraction 
As  discussed  in  the  Section  2,  we  can  use  the  POI  category 
database  to  get  the  statistics  (counts)  of  different  POIs  in  an 

interested region. In particular, given a stay region (cid:1870)(cid:3036)∈(cid:1844),1≤(cid:1861)≤
(cid:1865),  we  will  count  the  number  of  different  POIs  in  an  enclosing 
rectangle of the stay points in (cid:1870)(cid:3036), with the coordinates as [ri.lat - 
enclosing  rectangle  is (cid:1856)×(cid:1856) .  Denote  the  count  vector  for  a 
matrix (cid:1851)(cid:3040)×(cid:3039). Specifically, we have each entry of Y as 
|(cid:3419)(cid:2199)(cid:3284): (cid:3044)(cid:3284)(cid:3285)(cid:2997)(cid:2868)(cid:3423)|,∀(cid:1861)=1,…,(cid:1865); (cid:1862)=1,…,(cid:1864), 
(cid:1851)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)= (cid:3044)(cid:3284)(cid:3285)∑
|{(cid:2199)(cid:3284)}|
(cid:3044)(cid:3284)(cid:3285)
(cid:3287)(cid:3285)(cid:3128)(cid:3117)

location i as qi = [qi1, qi2, …, qil] for l types of POIs. Consider that 
some types of POIs (e.g. restaurants) are more popular than others 
(e.g.  movie  theaters),  we  follow  information  retrieval  to  further 
normalize  these  counts  in  the  form  of  term-frequency  inversed-
document-frequency  (TF-IDF)  [8]  to  obtain  a  location-feature 

d/2, ri.lat + d/2] × [ri.lng – d/2, ri.lng + d/2]. Here, d is the size 
parameter as introduced in Section 3.1. Therefore, the size of the 

∙(cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859)

(3) 

where |{qi}| is the number of all the count vectors (i.e. number of 
locations), and |{qi: qij > 0}| is the number of count vectors (i.e. 
locations)  having  non-zero  j-th  type  POIs.  In  this  way,  we 
reasonably increase the weights for those important POIs that are 
fewer but unique (e.g. movie theaters), and decrease the weights 
for those extensively distributed POIs (e.g. restaurants).  
3.4  Activity-Activity Correlation Extraction 
Knowing  the  correlations  between  the  activities  can  help  us  to 
better infer what the users may do in some location based on the 
observation of the activities performed before. One possible way 
to get such correlations is to calculate them directly from the GPS 
data; but due to the limited number of comments, we may not get 
reliable results. Fortunately, such activity correlations are usually 
common senses and possibly reflected on the World Wide Web. 
To  facilitate  such  common  sense  knowledge  mining,  we  turn  to 

Web  search  for  help.  In  particular,  for  each  pair  of  activities (cid:1853)(cid:3036) 
and (cid:1853)(cid:3037),  we  put  their  names  together  as  a  query  and  submit  it  to 

some  commercial  search  engine  to  get  the  Webpage  hit  counts. 
For example, for activities “food and drink” and “shopping”, we 
generate a query “food and drink, shopping” and send it to Bing. 
Bing will then return a list of Webpages that describe these two 
activities together, and as expected, the number of such returned 
Webpages  implies  the  correlation  between  them.  In  general,  we 
find the hit count for “food and drink, shopping” (30.3 million hits 
from  Bing)  is  higher  than  that  for  “food  and  drink,  sports  and 
exercises”  (7.56  million  hits),  showing  that  the  correlations  of 
“food and drink” with “shopping” is higher than that with “sports 
and exercise”, coinciding with the common sense.  
Based  on  such  a  method,  we  can  then  have  an  activity-activity 

matrix (cid:1852)(cid:3041)×(cid:3041), with each entry defined as 

,∀(cid:1861)=1,…,(cid:1866); (cid:1862)=1,…,(cid:1866), 

(cid:1852)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)=ℎ(cid:3036)(cid:3037) ℎ∗⁄

 (4) 

 

where ℎ(cid:3036)(cid:3037)is the hit count for activity i and activity j based on some 
search  engine. ℎ∗=(cid:1853)(cid:1870)(cid:1859)(cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876) ℎ(cid:3036)(cid:3037),∀(cid:1861),(cid:1862) is  the  maximal  hit  count 

among all the hit counts for each pair of activities.  
4.  COLLABORATIVE LOCATION AND 
ACTIVITY RECOMMENDATIONS 
After the data modeling, we have the location-activity, location-
feature  and  activity-activity  matrices.  As  the  location-activity 
matrix is incomplete with many missing entries, our objective is 
to  fill  those  missing  entries  so  as  to  get  a  full  location-activity 
matrix  for  location  and  activity  recommendations.  Since  the 
location-activity  matrix  is  very  sparse,  we  try  to  borrow  some 
more  information  from  location-feature  and  activity-activity 
matrices for prediction based on collaborative filtering.

factorization model and formulate our objective function as: 

Figure  7  demonstrates  the  main  idea  of  our  model  based  on 
collective matrix factorization. Given the location-activity matrix 

(cid:1850)(cid:3040)×(cid:3041), we decompose it by low-rank approximation as a product 
of  two  matrices (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038)  and (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038)  (the  superscript  “T”  for (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038)(cid:3021)  
denotes the matrix transpose), where (cid:1863)<(cid:1866). It shares the location 
information  through  sharing  matrix (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038)  with  the  location-
feature  matrix (cid:1851)(cid:3040)×(cid:3039) ,  which  is  decomposed  as  a  product  of 
matrices (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038) and (cid:1849)(cid:3039)×(cid:3038).  Similarly,  the  location-activity  matrix 
shares  the  activity  information  through  sharing matrix (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038) with 
the  activity-activity  matrix (cid:1852)(cid:3041)×(cid:3041),  which  is  decomposed  as  a  self 
product  of (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038) .  Hence,  we  put  forward  a  collective  matrix 
(cid:1838)((cid:1847),(cid:1848),(cid:1849))=12∥(cid:1835)∘((cid:1850)−(cid:1847)(cid:1848)(cid:3021))∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)+(cid:2019)(cid:2869)2∥(cid:1851)−(cid:1847)(cid:1849)(cid:3021)∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)+ 
   (cid:3090)(cid:3118)(cid:2870)∥(cid:1852)−(cid:1848)(cid:1848)(cid:3021)∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)+(cid:3090)(cid:3119)(cid:2870)(∥(cid:1847)∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)+∥(cid:1848)∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)+∥(cid:1849)∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870)), (5) 
where ∥∙∥(cid:3007)denotes  the  Frobenius  norm.  I  is  an  indicator  matrix 
with  its  entry (cid:1835)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)=0  if (cid:1850)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)  is  missing, (cid:1835)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)=1  otherwise.  The 
operator  “∘”  denotes  the  entry-wise  product.  As  shown  in  the 
information  among (cid:1850)(cid:3040)×(cid:3041), (cid:1851)(cid:3040)×(cid:3039) and (cid:1852)(cid:3041)×(cid:3041),  by  requiring  them  to 
share  some  low-rank  matrices (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038)  and (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038) .  The  first  three 
variables (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038), (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038) and (cid:1849)(cid:3039)×(cid:3038),  and  we  cannot  get  closed-form 
(denoted as ∇) for each variable as 
∇(cid:2905)(cid:1838)=[(cid:1835)∘((cid:1847)(cid:1848)(cid:3021)−(cid:1850))](cid:1848)+(cid:2019)(cid:2869)((cid:1847)(cid:1849)(cid:3021)−(cid:1851))(cid:1849)+(cid:2019)(cid:2871)(cid:1847), 
         ∇(cid:2906)(cid:1838)=[(cid:1835)∘((cid:1847)(cid:1848)(cid:3021)−(cid:1850))](cid:3021)(cid:1847)+2(cid:2019)(cid:2870)((cid:1848)(cid:1848)(cid:3021)−(cid:1852))(cid:1848)+(cid:2019)(cid:2871)(cid:1848),   (6) 

terms  in  the  objective  function  (5)  control  the  loss  in  matrix 
factorization, and the last term controls the regularization over the 
factorized matrices so as to prevent overfitting.  
In general, this objective function is not jointly convex to all the 

solutions  for  minimizing  the  objective  function.  Therefore,  we 
will  turn  to  some  numerical  method  such  as  gradient  descent  to 
get the local optimal solutions. Specifically, we have the gradients 

Figure  7  and  the  objective  function,  we  aim  to  propagate  the 

∇(cid:2907)(cid:1838)=(cid:2019)(cid:2869)((cid:1847)(cid:1849)(cid:3021)−(cid:1851))(cid:3021)(cid:1847)+(cid:2019)(cid:2871)(cid:1849). 

After  having  the  gradients,  we  can  use  gradient  descent  to 
iteratively  minimize  the  objective  function.  The  details  of  the 
algorithm are given in Figure 8.

rating for an activity. Assume from left to right in x, the activities 
are “Food”, “Shopping”, “Sports”, “Tourism” and “Movie”, then 
we will recommend a ranking list of activities with “Tourism” > 
“Sports”  >  “Shopping”  >  “Food”  >  “Movie”.  Similarly,  for 
location recommendation, given a user query of some activity, we

corresponding activities for activity commendation. For example,

Figure 9. GPS user statistics 

Figure  10(A)  shows  the  GPS  devices  used  to  collect  data.  They 
are comprised of stand-alone GPS receivers and GPS phones. In 
general, the sampling rate for GPS devices is set as two seconds. 
The GPS logs were collected in China, as well as a few cities in 
the USA, South Korea, and Japan. As most parts of the logs were 
generated in Beijing, and for easier evaluation of our system, we 
extract the logs from Beijing for our experiments. After this data 
preprocessing, we obtain a dataset having 12,765 GPS trajectories 

with total GPS points number over 3,980,320 and total trajectory 
length over 139,310 kilometers. We have totally 530 comments. 
To make sure that we recommend useful locations and activities, 
we also remove some GPS points for work and homes. The data 
distribution  in  Beijing  is  shown  in  Figure  10(B).  To  protect  the 
users’ privacy, we use these data anonymously.

We  defined  5  activities  to  recommend  from  the  GPS  data.  As 
shown in Table 1, these 5 activities basically cover people’s daily 
routines. Therefore, n=5 for the matrices X and Z in Eq.(5).

5.1.2  Parameter Selection 
Data  processing  parameters.  In this experiment, to obtain stay 
points from raw GPS data, we follow our previous work [9] to set 
Tthreh  as  20  minutes  and  Dthreh  as  200  meters  for  stay  point 
detection. To extract stay regions from stay points, we tentatively 
set  the  stay  region  size  as  300×300  square  meters,  i.e.  d  =  300, 
and we will study its impact in Section 5.3.2.  

Model  parameters.  Our  model  has  3  parameters: (cid:2019)(cid:2869),(cid:2019)(cid:2870) and (cid:2019)(cid:2871), 
where  (cid:2019)(cid:2869) and (cid:2019)(cid:2870) control the contributions of location features and 
in Section 5.3.1. (cid:2019)(cid:2871) controls the regularization term, and we set it 

activity correlations respectively, and we will study their impacts 

as 10 through all our experiments. As our model is based on low-
rank matrix factorization, we set the rank k=3 for the matrices U, 
V and W in Eq.(5). 
5.2  Evaluation Methodology 
To  evaluate  our  recommendation  system,  we  invited  5  subjects 
who are familiar with Beijing, to individually use our system and 
provide the feedbacks. For activity recommendation, we asked the 
subjects to evaluate the top 5 recommended activities on the top 
20 popular locations according to the GPS logs; and for location 
recommendation, we asked them to evaluate top 10 recommended 
locations. Our system’s user interface is shown in Figure 4, where 
users can provide ratings to the recommended locations/activities.

In Table 2, we list the rating criteria. To get the ground truths for 
evaluation, we aggregate all the subjects’ feedbacks to get an ideal 
ranking  list.  As  our  recommendations  are  based  on  ranking 
results,  we  employ  normalized  discounted  cumulative  gain 
(nDCG) [8] to measure our retrieved location/activity list. nDCG 
is commonly used in information retrieval to measure the search 
engine’s  performance.  A  higher  nDCG  value  to  a  list  of  search 
results  means  that,  the  highly  relevant  items  appearing  earlier 
(with  higher  ranks)  in  the  result  list.  In  particular,  nDCG[p],  or 
referred as nDCG@p, measures the relevance of top p results: 

(cid:3010)(cid:3005)(cid:3004)(cid:3008)[(cid:3043)],(cid:1830)(cid:1829)(cid:1833)[(cid:1868)]=(cid:1870)(cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:2869)+∑

5.3  Results and Discussions 
In  this  section,  we  will  first  study  our  system’s  performances 
under  different  model  parameters.  Then,  we  will  employ  two 
baselines for comparison under several settings. Finally, we will 
give some more insights to our model. 
5.3.1  System performance 
5.3.1.1  Impact of the location feature information 

The parameter (cid:2019)(cid:2869) controls the contribution of the location feature 
this  information,  we  vary  the  value  of (cid:2019)(cid:2869) and  plot  our  model’s 
in  Figure  11.  In  this  study,  we  fix (cid:2019)(cid:2870) =200,  which  is  in  the 

information to the objective function (5). To study the impact of 

performances with the average nDCG values over all the subjects

magnitude  of  division  of  the  location-feature  matrix  size  by  the 
activity-activity matrix size. In this way, we make sure that both 
location  features  and  activity  correlations  can  contribute  to  the 
objective  function.  We  use  nDCG@5  to  evaluate  the  results  for 
activity recommendation and nDCG@10 for location recommend-
ation in this paper if without specific references.

    (B) location recommendation. 

(A) activity recommendation 

Figure 11. Impact of the location features 

As  shown  in  Figure  11(A),  the  model’s  performance  first 

increases  and  later  decreases  as (cid:2019)(cid:2869)  increases.  This  is  because 
when (cid:2019)(cid:2869)  is  too  small,  the  model  cannot  fully  utilize  the 
functionalities and the connections among the locations. When (cid:2019)(cid:2869) 

information from the location features to understand the location 

is  too  large,  the  location  feature  information  will  dominate  the 
objective function (5), thus overwhelming the activity information 
from the location-activity matrix X and activity-activity matrix Z.  
It  will  cause  some  problem;  for  example,  given  two  locations  i 
and j with similar location features, if location i has no rating for 
“food  and  drink”  but  has  ratings  for  “movie  and  shows”, 
according to location similarity, we cannot recommend to users to 

exploiting  one  additional  information  source,  i.e.  the  activity-
activity correlation, to help recommendation. As the performance 

try “food and drink” at location j although usually there are some 
nice  restaurants  near  the  movie  theatres.  In  Figure  11(B),  we 
observe  the  similar  pattern  for  location  recommendation.  When 
the location-activity ratings are not well inferred with too small or 

too  large(cid:2019)(cid:2869),  the  recommended  location  list  also  may  miss  some 
interesting places. Note that, when (cid:2019)(cid:2869)=0, the model equals to only 
at (cid:2019)(cid:2869)=0 can be lower than the performance at (cid:2019)(cid:2869)>0 (e.g. (cid:2019)(cid:2869)=0.1), 
We  also  study  the  impact  of  parameter (cid:2019)(cid:2870),  which  controls  the 
function  (5).  We  vary  the  value  of (cid:2019)(cid:2870)  and  plot  our  model’s 
performances in Figure 12. In this study, we fix (cid:2019)(cid:2869)=0.1 according 

we demonstrate the benefit of using both additional information.

     (B) location recommendation 

 

(A) activity recommendation 

Figure 12. Impact of the activity correlations 

As  shown  in  Figure  12(A),  similarly  we  observe  the  model’s 

the  activity  correlations  will  dominate  the  objective  function,  so 
that for a location it will recommend the activities mostly based 
the correlation values while not fully considering whether such a 
location  is  suitable  for  some  activity.  For  example, if a  location 

performance first increasing and later decreasing as (cid:2019)(cid:2870) increases. 
When (cid:2019)(cid:2870) is too small, the activity correlation information cannot 
contribute  much  to  the  objective  function.  When (cid:2019)(cid:2870) is  too  large, 
has some ratings for “food and drink”, then with too large (cid:2019)(cid:2870), the 
location recommendation. Note that, when (cid:2019)(cid:2870)=0, the model equals 
features. Again, as the performance at (cid:2019)(cid:2870)=0 can be lower than the 
performance at (cid:2019)(cid:2870)>0 (e.g. (cid:2019)(cid:2870)=200), we demonstrate the benefit of 

model  will  also  recommend  the  user  to  see  “movie  and  shows” 
without carefully considering whether this location has theatre or 
not.  In  Figure  12(B),  we  can  observe  the  similar  pattern  for 

to only exploiting one additional information source for location 

exploiting both additional information sources. 
5.3.2  Investigation into Our System 
5.3.2.1  Comparison with baselines 
We employ two baselines: single collaborative filtering (SCF) and 
unifying  collaborative  filtering  (UCF).  In  SCF,  we  only  use  the 
incomplete  location-activity  matrix  as  input  for  collaborative 
filtering.  We  employ  the  popular  low-rank  matrix  factorization 
approach to accomplish such a collaborative filtering task [18]. In 
particular,  SCF  aims  to  solve  an  singular  value  decomposition 

problem  by min(cid:1836)((cid:1847),(cid:1848))=∥(cid:1835)∘((cid:1850)−(cid:1847)(cid:1848)(cid:3021))∥(cid:3007)(cid:2870) ,  where  X  denotes 
objective function (5) has both (cid:2019)(cid:2869) and (cid:2019)(cid:2870) as zeros. We employ this 

the incomplete location-activity matrix, U and V are the low-rank 
matrices, I is the indicator matrix same with Eq.(5). It can be seen 
that  this  optimization  problem  equals  to  the  case  when  our 

baseline to show that with limited number of comments (and thus 
sparse  in  location-activity  matrix),  the  recommendation  results 

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1035may not be satisfying. So we can validate our motivation to use 
additional information sources to help improve recommendation.  
We also follow [10] to provide a solution, UCF, which can use the 
additional information sources for unifying collaborative filtering. 
In UCF, for each missing entry in the location-activity matrix, it 
will  extract  a  set  of  top  N  similar  locations  and  top  N  similar 
activities, and then use the ratings for these users over these items 
in a probabilistic way to calculate a value for the missing entry. 
After  all  the  missing  entries  are  filled  in  the  location-activity 
matrix,  similar  ranking  strategy  with  our  system  can  be  used  to 
output the location and activity ranking list for recommendations. 
We use this baseline to testify the effectiveness of our model over 
other collaborative filtering methods given the same inputs.

In  Table  3,  we  report  the  performances  of  our  model  and  other 
two baselines for both activity and location recommendations. We 
vary  the  p-values  for  nDCG@p  to  extensively  evaluate  the 
systems’  performances.  The  entry  value  in  Table  3  denotes  the 
mean and standard deviation of the nDCG values. As shown in the 
table,  our  model  CLAR  consistently  outperforms  the  two 
baselines  under  different  measurements.  We  also  conduct  the  t-
test  over  the  results  and  find  our  results  are  significantly  better 
than the baselines’ results (one-tailed test p1<0.01, two-tailed test 
p2<0.01) in both location and activity recommendations. Both our 
CLAR  and  UCF  can  outperform  SCF  due  to  using  more 
information. Besides, our CLAR can outperform UCF because in 
UCF, the information flow is in a single direction from location 
features  and  activity  correlations  while  our  CLAR  enables  the 
information flow in both directions. In other words, in UCF, the 
location similarities and activity similarities are learned from the 
location features and activity correlations; then they are passed to 
the  location-activity  matrix  for  collaborative  filtering.  This 
collaborative  filtering  does  not  have  further  feedback  to  the 
location-features  and  activity  correlations.  So,  if  the  similarities 
learned from this additional information are not accurate, there is 
no second chance to refine. In contrast, in our CLAR, we put the 
location-activity  matrix  and 
two  pieces  of  additional 
information together in an objective function for optimization, so 
that  we  can  have  the  feedback  from  the  matrix  factorization  in 
location-activity matrix to the location-feature matrix and activity-
activity  correlation  matrix.  In  this  way,  our  CLAR  can  have  bi-
directional information flows and thus outperform UCF. 
5.3.2.2  Impact of the stay region size 
We also study the impact of stay region size in recommendation. 
As discussed above, in recommendations, we may prefer smaller 
stay region size so that the users can easily find what she wants in 
the  recommended  location.  Therefore,  we  vary  the  stay  region 
size  by  varying  the  region  width  d  from  200  to  at  most  500 
(d=500 means that the stay region size is 500×500 square meters).  
As shown in Table 4, as the stay region size increases, the number 
of  stay  regions  extracted  by  grid-based  clustering  (shown  in 
Figure  6)  decreases.  Our  CLAR  model  consistently  outperforms 
the two baselines UCF and SCF. We also conduct the t-test and 
find  our  results  are  better  than  the  baselines’  results  (one-tailed 
test p1<0.05, two-tailed test p2<0.05) in both location and activity 

the 

recommendations.  When  d=300,  our  CLAR  works  the  best, 
showing  that too  small  region  size  may  make  the  extracted  stay 
regions’  location  features  insufficient  to  represent  the  location 
functionalities and too large region size may lead to difficulty in 
finding interested points of interests from a big area.

5.3.2.3  Impact of the user number 
As the GPS devices become popular, we will have more and more 
users and accumulate such GPS data on the Web as time goes by. 
We  study  the  impact  of  user  numbers  so  as  to  see  whether  our 
system can handle the data well.

As  the  user  number  increases,  the  GPS  data  size  increases  and 
thus the number of stay points also increases (though it might not 
be the case when the user number is sufficiently large). As shown 
in Table 5, the running time for our CLAR model is almost linear 
to  the  number  of  stay  points.  This  is  because  the  computational 
complexity  of  our  CLAR  model  is  linear  to  the  number  of  stay 
points. Consider the algorithm for our CLAR model in Figure 8. 

Given  the  input  matrices (cid:1850)(cid:3040)×(cid:3041), (cid:1851)(cid:3040)×(cid:3039) , (cid:1852)(cid:3041)×(cid:3041) and  their  low-rank 
factorized matrices (cid:1847)(cid:3040)×(cid:3038), (cid:1848)(cid:3041)×(cid:3038), (cid:1849)(cid:3039)×(cid:3038), we have the computational 
complexity  of  evaluating  the  objective  function  (5)  is: (cid:1865)×(cid:1863)×
(cid:1866)+(cid:1865)×(cid:1863)×(cid:1864)+(cid:1866)×(cid:1863)×(cid:1866)+((cid:1865)×(cid:1866)+(cid:1866)×(cid:1863)+(cid:1864)×(cid:1863)), which is 
(cid:1841)((cid:1865)) since n, l and k are much smaller than m (e.g. in our case 
the computational complexity for the gradients as (cid:1841)((cid:1865)). As our 
for our model is linear to the number of stay points (cid:1841)((cid:1865)). Hence, 

algorithm  has an  iteration  limit  and  in  practice  it converges  fast 
(in less than 300 iterations), the whole computational complexity 

with 162 users, m=12656, n=5, l=13, k=3). Similarly, we can have 

our model can be quite efficient. From Table 5, we also observe 
that  as  the  user  number  increases,  there  are  more  GPS  data  and 
thus we can keep improving the system’s performance. 
5.3.3  Discussions 
5.3.3.1  Impact of the location types to activity 
recommendation 
Is our system doing equally well on activity recommendation for 
different  types  of  locations?  We  summarize  the  experimental 
results  for  the  setting  with  d=300  and  #user=162  to  answer  this 
question in Figure 13. As can be seen from the figure, for the 20 
most popular locations, our system works the best on the locations 
that are in the type of “food and sports area”, and the worst on the 
locations that are in the type of “shopping and movie area” (here 
we aggregate the user evaluations and pick the top 2 activities as 
the location types). This is because the activity “food and drink” 
happens more often in our daily life; and it’s also more likely to 

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1036have many restaurant POIs in the location feature for predicting 
this activity. For “sports” areas, the location features can capture 
the location functionality by detecting the parks and stadiums. For 
“tourism” areas, there are more comments from the GPS users, so 
that the prediction on such areas can be comparatively accurate. 
For  the  “shopping  &  movie”  area,  the  activity  recommendation 
results are not as good as the other areas, because there are fewer 
comments from the GPS users on these activities and thus fewer 
ratings  in  collaborative  filtering.  Besides,  such  areas  are  usually 
also suitable for food hunting and sometimes tourism, so that they 
are overwhelmed by the recommendations to food and tourism.

We also ask the question whether our system does equally well on 
location  recommendation  for  different  activity  types?  Based  on 
the same setting with previous section, we summarize the location 
recommendation results on each activity type in Figure 14.

Figure 14. Impact of activity types to location recommend. 

As  expected,  for  activity  “food  and  drinks”  which  more  often 
happens, and activity “tourism and amusement” which has more 
user  comments,  the  recommendation  results  are  quite  satisfying. 
For “movie and shows”, the results are still good. For “shopping”, 
the performance is worse due to less user comments in modeling 
the location-activity matrix for collaborative filtering. For “sports 
and exercises”, the performance is also worse than other activities; 
and  an  interesting  observation  is  that,  in  Figure  13,  our  system 
usually  performs  well  on  the  “sports”  areas.  Is  there  something 
wrong?  By  analyzing  the  data,  we  find  that  this  is  reasonable; 
because in our system the locations with more comments are more 
likely  to  be  recommended  (i.e.  the  higher  ratings  on  other 
activities can propagate to the activity “sports”), but most of these 
locations  are  related  to  food  hunting  and  tourism  which  are 
loosely  connected  with  “sports”.  As  a  result,  the  location 
recommendation for the activity “sports” is worse than the others. 
5.3.3.3  Prediction for new locations and activities 
Our system is based on some GPS data which is limited in size. 
Therefore, there could be some locations that we do not see in the 
existing  GPS  dataset.  Similarly,  we  also  only  define  5  main 

activities, what if the user wants to get recommendations for some 
more-detailed  activities,  such  as  “Thai  food”  instead  of  general 
“food”?  One  possible  solution  could  be  relying  on  the  data 
accumulation on the Web. As the GPS devices become popular, 
there  can  be  more  and  more  GPS  data  related  to  more  detailed 
activities in people’s daily life. Once we have these data, we can 
keep  updating  our  system.  Since  our  model’s  computational 
complexity is linear to the number of GPS stay points (i.e. the data 
size), such updates could be easy. Another possible solution is to 
get such location-activity information from the Web. As there are 
blogs describing such information (e.g. travel logs), we may mine 
such knowledge from the Web to enhance our system. However, 
considering that the blog contents can be quite noisy, it’s not clear 
how much it helps. We may leave it as our future study. 
6.  RELATED WORK 
6.1  Location Recommendation 
Location  recommendation  has  been  an  important  topic  in  geo-
related  services.  Some  systems,  based  on  an  individual  user’s 
current  location,  retrieve  important  surrounding  locations  and 
their  contexts  for  recommendations.  For  example,  in  [12],  a 
mobile application framework, which enables a mobile phone user 
to  query  the  geo-coded  Wikipedia  articles  for  landmarks  in 
vicinity, is presented. In [13], a Cyberguide system is developed 
to  provide  the  librarian  information  which  describes  the  nearby 
buildings and related people identities. Comparatively, our system 
exploits the user location histories and recommends the interesting 
locations all round the city instead of only nearby locations.  
There are some systems focusing on recommending some specific 
types of locations. For example, in [14], a CityVoyager system is 
developed to recommend shops. It collects the users’ shop visiting 
histories based on GPS logs, and uses an item-based collaborative 
filtering  method  to  recommend  to  a  user  some  shops  that  are 
similar  to  his/her  previously  visited  shops.  In  [15],  a  system 
considering  both  users’  preferences  and  location  contexts  is 
shown  to  recommend  restaurants.  It  uses  Bayesian  learning  to 
calculate  some  recommendation  values  for  restaurants  so  as  to 
provide  a  ranking  list  for  recommendation.  Similarly,  in  [16],  a 
Geowhiz  system,  which  uses  a  user-based  collaborative  filtering 
algorithm  to  recommend  restaurants,  is  proposed.  In  [9],  the 
recommended locations are hot spots for tourism. A HITS-based 
model is proposed to take into account a user’s travel experience 
and the interest of a location in recommendation, so that only the 
locations  that  are  really  popular  and  also  recommended  by 
experienced  users  can  be  recommended.  In  contrast  to  those 
systems  limited  in  modeling  only  one  type  of  location  for 
recommendations, our system is capable to handle various types 
of  locations.  That  is,  we  can  recommend  locations  not  only  for 
foods and drinks but also for shopping, etc.  
6.2  Activity Recommendation 
Activity recommendation is a pretty new research issue with little 
research  on  it  so  far.  Yet  it  is  a  quite  common  question  in  our 
daily life to ask what we can do if we want to visit some place. 
Most  of  the  previous  work  related  to  activity  study  focuses  on 
how  to  recognize  an  activity  from  sensor  data  by  ubiquitous 
computing  [21].  For  example,  in  [5],  based  on  GPS  data,  a 
hierarchical conditional random field model is used to recognize 
whether a user is at work, or sleeping at home, or taking leisure, 
or  visiting  friend,  etc.  In  [17],  activities  of  daily  living  such  as 
brushing  teeth  or  making  a  snack  in  indoor  environment  are 
recognized  by  using  RFID  sensors.  Some  object  use  common 
sense  knowledge  is  extracted  from  Web  to  help  training  a 

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1037recognition model in an unsupervised way. In contrast, rather than 
recognize the activity for an individual user in real time, we aim 
to do mining over the  users’ activity histories (i.e. GPS logs) and 
recommend what a user can do on some location.  
7.  CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we studied how to mine knowledge from the real-
world GPS data to answer two common questions in our daily life. 
The first question is, if we want to do something, where shall we 
go?  This  question  corresponds  to  location  recommendation.  The 
second question is, if we visit some place, what can we do? This 
question  corresponds  to  activity  recommendation.  We  show  that 
these two questions are inherently related, as they can be seen as a 
ranking  problem  over  a  location-activity  rating  matrix.  Because 
the location-activity matrix is very sparse in practice, we proposed 
to  exploit  other  information,  including  the  location  features  and 
the activity-activity correlations from various information sources, 
to enhance the performance. We provided a collaborative filtering 
approach  based  on  collective  matrix  factorization  to  take  these 
information  sources  as  inputs  and  train  a  location  and  activity 
recommender. Both PC and hand-held device users can access our 
recommender through the Web to get recommendations for better 
trip  planning,  etc.  We  evaluated  our  system  on  a  large  GPS 
dataset, and showed 7% improvement on activity recommendation 
and over 20% improvement on location recommendation over the 
simple baseline without exploiting any additional information. 
In  the  future,  we  will  consider  more  information,  such  as  user 
features, to further enhance the performance. Our current system 
is for general recommendations; if we have the user features, we 
may be able to personalize our recommendation system so as to 
better satisfy the user’s information needs. Besides, we may also 
use the user features to establish a social network among the users 
so that the experiences from friend (similar) users can contribute 
more in retrieving recommendation results.
