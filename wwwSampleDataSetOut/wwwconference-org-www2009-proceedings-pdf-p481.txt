ABSTRACT
Discovering users’ speciﬁc and implicit geographic intention
in web search can greatly help satisfy users’ information
needs. We build a geo intent analysis system that uses
minimal supervision to learn a model from large amounts
of web-search logs for this discovery. We build a city lan-
guage model, which is a probabilistic representation of the
language surrounding the mention of a city in web queries.
We use several features derived from these language models
to: (1) identify users’ implicit geo intent and pinpoint the
city corresponding to this intent, (2) determine whether the
geo-intent is localized around the users’ current geographic
location, (3) predict cities for queries that have a mention
of an entity that is located in a speciﬁc place. Experimental
results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of using features de-
rived from the city language model. We ﬁnd that (1) the
system has over 90% precision and more than 74% accuracy
for the task of detecting users’ implicit city level geo intent
(2) the system achieves more than 96% accuracy in deter-
mining whether implicit geo queries are local geo queries,
neighbor region geo queries or none-of these (3) the city
language model can eﬀectively retrieve cities in location-
speciﬁc queries with high precision (88%) and recall (74%);
human evaluation shows that the language model predicts
city labels for location-speciﬁc queries with high accuracy
(84.5%).

INTRODUCTION

Many times a user’s information need has some kind of
geographic boundary associated with it. For example, when
the user issues the query “manhattan coﬀee”, he probably
wants information only about coﬀee shops in the Manhat-
tan region of New York. Previous research has shown that a
signiﬁcant portion (more than 13%) of web queries contain
geographic (henceforth referred to as geo) information [9,
16, 19]. There are many uses of identifying geo information
in user queries for various retrieval tasks: we can person-

alize retrieval results based on the geo information in the
query and improve a user’s search experience; we can also
provide better advertisement matching and deliver more in-
formation about local goods and services that users may be
interested in. Many researchers have demonstrated how to
improve retrieval performance for a query by incorporating
related geo information [2, 20] when this information explic-
itly appears in the query or is known beforehand. However,
recent research has found that only about 50% of queries
with geo intent, i.e., queries where the users expected the
results to be contained within some geographic radius, had
explicit location names [19]. For example, many users search
for “pizza” expecting the search engine to detect their loca-
tion and correspondingly present results in their neighbor-
hood automatically. Therefore, identifying implicit geo in-
tent and accurately discovering missing location information
is important and necessary for using any retrieval model that
leverages geo information. We expect that in handheld de-
vices like cell-phones, the percentage of queries with implicit
geo intent will be much higher.

In our work, we develop techniques to discover geo in-
tention even when explicit geo information is missing, and
further explore diﬀerences between geo intent queries. To-
wards this goal, we ﬁrst address the challenging task of dis-
covering a user’s implicit geo intention at a ﬁne grained, i.e.,
city/location level. Previous research has shown that a large
portion (83.77%) of explicit geo queries contain city level in-
formation[9], which implies that users often have a city level
granularity in mind when issuing geo queries. We therefore
believe that ﬁnding implicit city/location level information
can greatly help satisfy users’ speciﬁc geo information needs,
e.g. a user who searches for ‘macy’s parade hotel rooms’ can
receive a variety of information about hotels in New York
City.

We then investigate diﬀerent localization capabilities be-
tween geo intent queries. For example, some queries may
imply users’ local geo information need, e.g.
the queries
‘pizza’ or ‘dentist’ typically imply that the user is looking
for information in some limited radius around their current
location, while other queries like ‘map’ or ‘hotel’ [9] may
imply that the user is looking for information in a far oﬀ
location from their current one, often say while planning a
trip. If we can automatically detect a geo query where the
location associated with the user intent is near that of the
physical location of the user, the IP location (or GPS in-
formation if the user is using a mobile phone) of the user
issuing this query can be used for searching and ﬁltering
so that more locally relevant information is delivered.
In

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: Search / Session: Query Categorization481our terminology, the queries “pizza” and “dentist” have high
localization capability. By the same measure, the queries
“map” and “hotel”, have geo intent, but no localization ca-
pability. We also examine the fact that some queries that
have localization capabilities may have a geographic region
of relevance that is of smaller radius than others. For ex-
ample, users may be willing to drive up to only 10 miles for
“pizza” but be willing to drive say up to 30 miles for a good
“dentist” and up to 100 miles for a bargain on a “2008 honda
civic”.

For the convenience of description, we consider that an
explicit geo intent query consists of (a) a location part: that
explicitly helps identify the location and (b) a non-location
part, e.g., in the query “pizza in 95054”, the term “95054” is
the location part and the remaining terms, the non-location
part. Welch and Cho [19] have recently found that features
derived from non-location parts of explicit geo queries in web
search logs can help identify queries that have implicit geo
intent. Nevertheless, their work only considers diﬀerentiat-
ing geo queries (explicit and implicit) from non-geo intent
queries and does not further investigate diﬀerent levels of
geo information and diﬀerent localization capabilities.

Our techniques stem from ideas in language modeling [6,
11] which have been widely utilized for natural language pro-
cessing, speech recognition and information retrieval (IR).
Basically, we build geo language models at a ﬁne grained
i.e., city level and extract n-gram language model features
for discovering users’ speciﬁc implicit geo intent. We also
combine many other appropriate language and non-language
geo features from ﬁned grained geo queries with n-gram fea-
tures for better geo-intent discovery. In order to be able to
accurately train diﬀerent language models for thousands of
diﬀerent cities and robustly extract geo features at ﬁne levels
of granularity, we utilize a sample from a months worth of
web search logs from a major search engine (Yahoo!) which
contains more than 2.8 billion search instances. We ﬁnd
that our city language models are good at predicting the
city pertinent to the query with very high accuracy.

Our chief contributions are (1) a method for identifying
users’ implicit city-level geo intent (2) a method for dis-
criminating diﬀerent localization capabilities of geo queries.
(3) a method for predicting the city corresponding to the
geo-intent in a location-speciﬁc query. (4) Our models are
learned from large amounts of click-through data and involve
little supervision. This allows us to quickly retrain models
on fresh data, and adapt to seasonal and other variations,
since the query logs are constantly evolving. For example,
we can quickly re-learn the location for the “next red sox
game”. Studying geo intent queries with the aim of ﬁnding
localization capabilities (city/location or a larger regional
level) can help better understand users’ underlying geo in-
tent, thus allowing us to better customize search results for
diﬀerent users. We begin by reviewing related work in §2,
and then describe our geo intention analysis system in de-
tail in §3 and §4. We describe the experimental setup and
the results of evaluating diﬀerent components of our system
in §5 and conclude in §6.

2. RELATED WORK

Although considerable work has been done on how to uti-
lize geographic information in meta data for IR [1, 12], re-
search on automatically detecting and understanding users’
diﬀerent geo intents in web search has just started. In 2007,

the GeoCLEF community began a geo query parsing and
classiﬁcation track [1], which required participants to not
only extract location and non-location topic information of
explicit geo queries but also required them to classify the
topics into three predeﬁned sub-categories:
informational
(e.g. news, blogs), yellow pages (e.g.
restaurants, hospi-
tals) and maps (e.g. rivers, mountains). Diﬀerent from this
track, our work aims at detecting users’ implicit geo intent
and classifying geo intent queries on the basis of diﬀerent
localization capabilities. Welch and Cho’s pilot study [19]
shows that features extracted from non-location parts of ex-
plicit geo queries can help discriminate queries that have
geo intent from those that don’t. Diﬀerent from their work,
we utilize more complex language modeling features for not
only detecting users’ implicit geo intent but also discovering
the exact missing location information and understanding
the localization capability of the geo information need.

Jones et al. [9] studied the relationship between the non-
location part of an explicit geo query and the distance of the
query’s location part from the issuer’s IP location and found
that geo queries have varied distance distribution and there-
fore diﬀerent localization capabilities. We further use this
distance between the IP and the city of intent in a geo-query
to label geo queries into several sub-categories and study the
utility of language modeling features for discriminating be-
tween these categories. Other research [22] considers using
statistics from the IP locations of users who clicked a given
query to study the query’s localization capability.

Raghavan et al. [14] built language models from the con-
textual language around diﬀerent name entities (e.g. person,
location, organization, etc) in a TREC corpus, and utilized
these entity language models for linking, clustering and clas-
sifying diﬀerent entities. Pasca [10] utilized diﬀerent contex-
tual language patterns in the search logs to extract diﬀerent
types of name entities. These works demonstrated the eﬀec-
tiveness of using contextual features for categorizing entities.
In our work, we build language models for geo location enti-
ties from large scale web search logs, and investigate whether
more complex contextual features can help discover users’
speciﬁc geo intent.

Besides using web search logs, some research [13] consid-
ers mining the returned web snippets from a commercial
search engine to discover missing local information. Other
research [18] considers mining both top web search results
and web search logs to disambiguate whether a query that
contains a geo location name implies geo intent, e.g. deter-
mining whether the query “New York Style cheesecake” is a
geo query, and discovering locations related to implicit geo
queries, e.g. ﬁnding “Seattle, WA” is related to the query
“space needle”. These works complement our approach to
better understand users’ implicit speciﬁc geo intent.

3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

In this paper we focus on building models using city level
geo information for detecting and discovering users’ speciﬁc
geo intent. The architecture of our geo intent analysis sys-
tem is depicted in Figure 1. Given a query Q = w1 · · · wn,
the system ﬁrst determines whether explicit geo informa-
tion exists: if yes, the system goes to the fourth step, which
divides the query into city and non-city parts Q = (Qc, Qnc)
and sends the non-city part Qnc back to the third component
of the system for analyzing users’ speciﬁc geo intent; other-
wise, the system goes to the second step to detect whether

the query has implicit city level geo intent by using the
ﬁrst level classiﬁer. If detected, the implicit city level geo
intent is further analyzed in the third step.

The third component discriminates users’ speciﬁc geo in-
tents within implicit geo queries. Here we intuitively deﬁne
three geo sub categories according to their diﬀerent local-
ization capabilities: (1) local geo queries, which consist
of geo queries that imply a user’s intention to ﬁnd locally
relevant information, e.g. ‘pizza’ or ‘dentist’; (2) neighbor
region geo queries, which consist of geo queries that im-
ply a user’s intention to ﬁnd related information from nearby
regions, e.g.
‘car dealer’ or ‘real estate’; and (3) remaining
geo queries that do not fall into the above three categories
and are not easily localized, e.g.
‘state maps’ or ‘hotels’.
By classifying geo queries into these sub categories, users’
speciﬁc geo information needs can be better satisﬁed: e.g.,
if the query is labeled as a ‘local geo query’, related local
information from or close to the user’s IP location can be
delivered.

We further use our city language models to predict cities
in location-speciﬁc queries. These queries usually con-
tain an entity (university, school, local media channel, doc-
tor name etc) through which one can pinpoint a location
(city/town level) corresponding to the geo-intent. We ﬁnd
that if the query contains such an entity, the city language
model is able to detect the city with very high accuracy. If
the query is labeled as a ‘location-speciﬁc query’, informa-
tion from the city where the entity occurs can be retrieved.
The results from the third component are combined with
other available information, e.g. the user’s IP location or an
explicit city name in the query, to customize results for dif-
ferent users and improve information retrieval performance.
The geo location analysis tool used in the second step
as a black-box for automatically identifying diﬀerent lev-
els of explicit geo information in queries has been used in
several past papers [9, 15]. This tool utilizes both context-
dependent (e.g.
‘in’,‘at’) and context-independent features
to ﬁnd possible location parts in a query, and maps these
location parts to a large global location databases contain-
ing zip-codes, cities, counties, states, countries etc. This
tool calculates a conﬁdence score in the range (0,1) for each
location candidate identiﬁed in the query based on the conﬁ-
dence of whether the candidate is indeed a geo location, and
outputs all the possible locations and conﬁdence scores. We
only consider location candidates whose conﬁdence scores
exceed 0.5. In addition, so as to limit our scope, we only con-
sider city location candidates that are in the United States.
Our major contribution is to design and evaluate the two
components that analyze users’ speciﬁc geo intent, (enclosed
in dashed lines in Figure 1). In the next section, we describe
how in each of these components language modeling tech-

niques are employed to build city-level geo language models,
and how rich geo language features at the city level are ex-
tracted for training the two classiﬁers. We emphasize that
studying ﬁne grained and complex geo language model fea-
tures is necessary for this task that is more challenging than
the task of identifying broad sense geo intent queries [19].
4. FEATURES FOR THE CLASSIFIERS

In this section we describe the set of features that were
extracted from the search logs. These features were used in
the construction of the two classiﬁers in Figure 1 and are
described in greater detail in §5.2 and §5.3. First, for each
query Q in the web search log, we correct possible spelling
errors, remove any stopwords present in the INQUERY [4]
stopword list1, and then utilize the geo location analysis tool
[15] to identify every possible explicit city level geo query.
That is, we decompose Qcg as (Qc, Qnc), where Qc and Qnc
denote the location/city and non-location part respectively.
This preprocessing step is similar to that employed by Welch
and Cho [19] except for two main diﬀerences: one is that we
utilize the geo location analysis tool instead of a dictionary
to identify the location part (Qc) in a query. Since the tool
uses contextual clues, it helps disambiguate whether a word
like “reading” refers to the location or to the verb sense of
“read”. This tool also covers zip-codes and many colloquial
geo location names, e.g. “nyc” for “New York City”, that may
appear in web queries. Therefore using this tool has some
advantages compared to the dictionary based approach of
Welch and Cho [19]. The other main diﬀerence is that in-
stead of generating a group of base queries from each query
by removing diﬀerent levels of possible location names, we
only generate one base query (from Qnc) by removing the
location part (Qc) for further feature extraction. We also do
not apply stemming because research show removing stop-
words has signiﬁcant positive impact for geo intent analysis
while stemming has little additional impact [19].

We then consider two diﬀerent ways of extracting city
level geo features for our modeling: the ﬁrst is by building
city language models by using all the identiﬁed non-location
portions (Qcg) in the training data; the second is by view-
ing each unigram, bigram and trigram in the non-city part
(Qnc) as a Geo Information Unit (GIU) that can help
discover users’ speciﬁc geo intent. We also collect various
statistics of these GIUs. We describe these two methods in
the following two subsections.
4.1 City Language Models

City names often have strong co-occurrence statistics with
terms or phrases like ‘map’, ‘hotel’, ‘hospital’ and so on in

1We remove ‘ﬀ’, ‘ﬁrst’ and ‘stave’ and ‘staves’ from the original
version and use the remaining 414 stopwords.

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: Search / Session: Query Categorization483the query logs. Therefore, analyzing the language used in
the non-city parts (Qnc) that co-occur with a certain city
name in the location part (Qc) can possibly help discover
missing city information in an implicit geo intent query.

To build language models for each city, we go beyond the
“bag of words” approach used in entity language models built
by Raghavan et al [14] and instead follow a bigram language
model approach. The reason is that bigram information can
be very important to infer implicit geo intent from phrases,
for e.g., the words ‘time’ and ‘square’ individually may not
imply geo intent, but the phrase ‘time square’ has a high pos-
sibility of being related to New York City. We do not build
trigram language models because trigrams in web queries
are much sparser than bigrams, making trigram language
models not as robust as bigram language models.
In the
typical bigram language modeling approach, the probability
of a string is expressed as the product of the probabilities
of the words that compose the string, where the probability
of each word is conditioned on the identity of the previous
word [6]; therefore, given a query Q = w1 · · · wn, we have:

P (Q) =

n
Y
i=1

P (wi|wi−1

1

) ≈

n
Y
i=1

P (wi|wi−1),

(1)

where wj
i denotes the string wi · · · wj . Then, for each city
Ck, we build bigram language models from the non-location
portions (Qnc) of all the explicit geo intent queries (Qcg)
that have the location portion (Qc) identiﬁed as the city
Ck. In this way, we can calculate the probability P (Q|Ck)
of a query Q generated from a city Ck’s language model by:

P (Q|Ck) =

n
Y
i=1

P (wi|wi−1

i=1

P (wi|wi−1, Ck).

Researchers have proposed a broad range of smoothing
techniques that adjust the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) of parameters to solve the zero frequency problem
in language modeling, and thereby produce more accurate
estimations and predictions. Many good comparison stud-
ies of diﬀerent smoothing techniques can be found in the
literature [6, 21]. Diﬀerent smoothing techniques can have
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results.
In this study, for the esti-
mation of bigram probability, we employ a state-of-the-art
smoothing technique (method B in Chen and Goodman[6]),
which combines two intuitions from the Dirichlet smoothing
and Good-Turing smoothing:

P (wi|wi−1, Ck) =

#(wi

i−1, Ck) + αP (wi|Ck)
#(wi−1, Ck) + α

, α = β × |VCk |,

(3)
where #(wj
i , Ck) denotes the frequency counts of the string
wj
i in the non-city parts (Qnc) related to the city Ck, |VCk |
denotes the vocabulary size of the words that appear in the
city Ck’s language model, α acts as the eﬀect of Dirichlet
smoothing, β is a constant to control the degree of smoothing
for diﬀerent cities that have diﬀerent vocabulary sizes. For
the unigram probability P (wi|Ck) in equation 3, we employ
the standard Dirichlet smoothing:

P (wi|Ck) = #(wi,Ck)+γP (wi|C•)
= #(wi,Ck)+γ#(wi,C•)/#(w•,C•)
,

#(w•,Ck)+γ

#(w•,Ck )+γ

where w• denotes all the words and C• denotes all the cities,
e.g. #(w•, Ck) denotes the counts of all the words appearing

in the non-location parts of geo-intent queries (Qnc) related
to the city Ck and #(w•, C•) denotes the counts of all the
words co-occurring with all the cities. γ is the Dirichlet
smoothing parameter.

For the task of detecting the cities relevant to a location
speciﬁc query, we calculate the posterior probability of each
query Q generated from a city Ci by:

P (Ci|Q) ∝ P (Ci)P (Q|Ci),

(5)

where we set the prior P (Ci) to be a uniform distribution,
i.e.
the posterior calculation will be only aﬀected by the
city generation probability P (Q|Ci), and not be biased to-
wards those cities that appear most frequently in the query
logs. After calculating all the posteriors, we can sort them
to discover the most probable cities that each implicit geo
query Q may be generated from. Table 1 shows the top-
5 cities and the corresponding posteriors calculated by our
city level language models, trained in experiments, for two
sample queries: “Disney world ticket” and “Harvard Univer-
sity”.
‘New Castle’ appears in the top cities related to the
ﬁrst query because of its ambiguous meaning – the geo anal-
ysis tool we used fails to determine whether it means a new
palace in Disney or the city named ‘New Castle’. We eval-
uate city language models for this task later in the paper
(refer §5.4).

These posteriors are useful as features to detect implicit
city level geo intent; therefore, we use them as geo language
model features for classiﬁcation as well as for discovering the
missing locations in the third component of Figure 1.
4.2 Geo Information Unit Features

Intuitively, the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams in the
non-city parts (Qnc) of explicit geo queries (Qcg) can help
detect users’ implicit geo intent, e.g.
the queries “golden
gate bridge” or “ﬁshermen’s wharf” may imply that users
are interested in information about San Francisco. Thus, we
view each unigram, bigram and trigram in the non-location
portions (Qnc) of all the geo-intent queries (Qcg) as a Geo
Information Unit (GIU) that can help discover users’ spe-
ciﬁc geo intent, and extract statistics in the training data
for each information unit. Then given any new input query
Q, we ﬁnd all the geo information units in this query and
utilize them to generate a wide range of features for various
classiﬁcation tasks.

For each n-gram GIU wi+n−1

= wi · · · wi+n−1 appear-
ing in the non-location part (Qnc)s of all geo-intent queries

After calculating the above features for each GIU, given a
new query Q, we can extract all the GIUs in it, and then
either directly utilize the features of these GIUs to form a
high dimensional sparse feature vector for represent-
ing this query, or aggregate some features to form a low
dimensional feature vector in order to reduce the train-
ing cost. For the high dimensional representation, each GIU
feature from each textually diﬀerent GIU occupies a diﬀer-
ent dimension in the feature vector. For the low dimensional
representation, we ﬁrst aggregate features from the unigram
GIUs, that is, for each of the GIU features we calculate the
typical statistics like minimum, maximum, and average of
the feature values from all the unigram GIUs and then keep
each statistic in a diﬀerent dimension in the feature vec-
tor. We aggregate bigram and trigram GIUs in the same
way and also keep calculated statistics in diﬀerent feature
dimensions. We test both approaches in experiments.
5. EXPERIMENTS

We designed three experiments to evaluate the major parts
of our system (enclosed in the dashed line in Figure 1) for
discovering users’ implicit speciﬁc geo intent: (1) The ﬁrst
experiment is to evaluate how the ﬁrst level classiﬁer – Clas-
siﬁer I, in the second component in Figure 1, performs to
detect users’ implicit city level geo intent when no explicit
city information is found in the query. (2) The second ex-
periment is to test how the well the second level classiﬁer
– Classiﬁer II, in the third component in Figure 1, cate-
gorizes implicit geo queries into diﬀerent localization capa-
bilities. (3) The third experiment is to investigate how well

our city language models detect location-speciﬁc queries and
discover missing city information.

In the next section we describe our data-set creation and
feature extraction methodology before we move on to de-
scribe the evaluation of the diﬀerent classiﬁers.
5.1 Data

We utilize a large industrial-scale real-world web search
log from Yahoo!
for this study. The training set is a
subset of the Yahoo! web search log during May, 2008. It
contains about 2.13 billion rows of search instance records
covering about 1.44 billion queries and related information,
e.g. users’ IP and the clicked URLs. The testing set is ran-
domly sampled from the Yahoo! web search log during June,
2008 and contains about 2.10 billion rows of search instance
records covering about 1.42 billion queries and related in-
formation. We applied the explicit geo information analysis
tool described in §3 on both the training and the testing sets
to identify each explicit geo query that contains a U.S. city
location candidate with the conﬁdence score larger than 0.5.
In this way, about 96.2M U.S. city level geo queries are iden-
tiﬁed in the training set and extracted to form a geo sub
training set, and about 96.7M U.S. city level geo queries
are identiﬁed in the testing set and extracted to form a geo
sub testing set. We ﬁnd 1614 distinct cities in the two geo
query subsets. Table 2 shows 5 most frequent cities in the
geo sub training/testing set respectively.

We build city language models for each city as described
in §4.1 by using all the explicit geo queries Qcg = (Qc, Qnc)
in the geo sub training set. Then given any implicit geo
query Q, we can calculate a set of city generation posteriors
P (Ci|Q) from the trained city language models, and use the
posteriors as the geo language model features for classiﬁca-
tion. In experiments we use the 10 largest posteriors of each
query as features for simplicity and noise reduction.

We then utilize all of the original training set and the geo
sub training set to extract GIU features for all the unigram,
bigram and trigram GIUs that appear in the queries (Qnc) in
the geo sub training set as described in §4.2. In experiments,
to reduce noise, we ﬁlter any n-gram GIU (wi+n−1
) that sat-
isﬁes the condition – min(Pg(wi+n−1
), P (wi+n−1
)) ≤ 1 ×
10−7 – and obtain 85078 unigram GIUs, 317628 bigram
GIUs and 191802 trigram GIUs. These GIUs are used for
calculating both a low and a high dimensional representation
for each query in later classiﬁcation tasks.

Next, we describe each experiment in detail, including how
we generate positive and negative samples for each task, the
classiﬁers used, and the evaluation results.

5.2 Evaluating Classiﬁer I

In this section we describe the details of how we build
models and evaluate the classiﬁer for city level geo-intent
detection (refer Figure 1).

Table 3: Some DNs in DN+ or DN−

5.2.1 Label Generation

Our automatic labeling method for this task utilizes URLs
that have been frequently clicked for a query to automati-
cally generate geo/non-geo intent labels for queries, instead
of hiring human editors to make judgments. For example,
if many users repeatedly clicked the URL local.yahoo.com
for a query, it has a high probability of having geo intent.

To ﬁnd URLs that reliably imply users’ geo intents, we
consider only the domain name (DN) of the URL. We collect
100 DNs that are most frequently clicked for queries in the
geo sub training set to form the set DN1. We also collect 100
DNs that are most frequently clicked from the other queries
that are not in the geo sub training set but in the whole
training set, into another set DN2. Then we obtain the DN
sets DN+ and DN− for labeling queries that may/may not
have geo intent by:

DN+ = DN1\DN2, DN− = DN2\DN1.

Some DNs that are intuitively useful for labeling users’ geo
intent and appear in both DN1 and DN2 end up being ex-
cluded from both DN+ and DN−. On analysis we found
a few possible reasons for this. For example, in the above
process, the clicked URLs of possible implicit geo queries or
larger regional level (state/country) geo queries are counted
in DN2. Similarly, the clicked URLs of some ambiguous
queries where the black-box tool [15] falsely identiﬁes city
names are counted in DN1. Therefore we introduce weak su-
pervision into this domain name selection process by putting
three useful DNs back to DN+ and two back to DN−:

DN+ = DN+ ∪ {www.citysearch.com,
www.yellowpages.com,
DN− = DN− ∪ {en.wikipedia.org, answers.yahoo.com}

local.yahoo.com}

In this way, we obtain 67 DNs in DN+ and 64 DNs in DN−
respectively. Some example DNs from the two sets are shown
in Table 3.

For any query in the geo sub training set, if it has a clicked
DN in DN+, we label the query as a positive sample. For any
query that is in the training set but not the geo sub training
set, if it has a clicked DN in DN−, we label the query as a
negative sample or non-geo intent query. We remove dupli-
cates that have the same query terms and domain names.
After that, we obtain 7.5M positive and 57.8M negative sam-
ples. We then use the location portion (Qc) of the positive
samples as the labels and the non-location portion (Qnc) as
the implicit geo intent queries. Next, we randomly sample
20,000 implicit geo queries and 20,000 non-geo queries to
obtain 40,000 queries in the training subset I.

For evaluation, we generate two testing subsets: test-
ing subset I-1 and testing subset I-2 from the original
testing set in two ways. The ﬁrst method is to follow the
same above procedure: labeling positive samples only from
queries in the geo sub testing set that have clicked DNs in
DN+ and extracting Qncs as the implicit geo intent queries;
labeling negative samples only from queries not in the geo

sub testing that have clicked DNs in DN−. In this way, we
obtain 8.0M implicit geo queries and 58.1M non-geo queries.
Then we randomly sample 80,000 queries ( half positive, half
negative) as the testing subset I-1.

The second method diﬀers from the ﬁrst in how it ﬁnds
the positive samples and creates the implicit geo queries. In
the second method, we directly label both positive and neg-
ative samples from the original testing set by only checking
whether they have clicked DNs in DN+ or DN−. We use
the black-box tool [15] to ﬁnd and remove all the possible
location portions (place names, zip-codes etc) in the posi-
tive and negative samples. Then we remove the duplicates.
In this way, we obtain 31.3M positive samples and 53.2M
negative samples. Then we randomly sample 80,000 queries
( half positive, half negative) as the testing subset I-2. Note
that classifying testing subset I-2 is more representative of
the true query log, and possibly harder, because positive
samples are directly obtained from the original testing set
instead of only from the geo sub testing set. Testing sub-
set I-2 may contain some real implicit geo queries instead of
only the queries (Qnc) from explicit geo queries as in testing
subset I-1.
5.2.2 Classiﬁers and Evaluation Results

We evaluate three state-of-the-art classiﬁcation techniques:
Support Vector Machines (SVM) [5], gradient boosted de-
cision tree [8] and multinomial logistic regression (MLGR)
[3] for building the ﬁrst level classiﬁer. For the SVM, we
employed linear kernel (SVM-Linear) as well as non-linear
RBF gaussian kernel (SVM-RBF). Training SVM-linear typ-
ically costs much less time than training SVM-RBF, while
SVM-RBF usually performs better when the original input
feature space is low dimensional. Decision trees have the
advantage that they can learn conjunctions of features. For
the gradient boosted decision trees, we used the TreeNet
tool by Salford Systems2. For the MLGR, we utilized the
open source R Project and its nnet library3.

For each labeled query sample, we calculate the geo lan-
guage model features – top-10 city generation posteriors,
and the GIU features (low/high dimensional feature vec-
tors), then combine them for classiﬁcation in two ways: 1)
a low training cost way, which only uses the posteriors and
the low dimensional GIU features, and 2) a high training
cost way, which uses all the features that include the high
dimensional GIU features in addition. Then we separately
scale each feature dimension to be in the range [0,1] for all
the samples, and train the classiﬁer based on diﬀerent mod-
els with the data in the training subset I. We employ 5-fold
cross validation to select the model parameters that achieve
the highest average accuracy. Then we test the optimized
classiﬁer on both the testing subset I-1 and I-2.

Performance is evaluated by using the typical precision,
recall and accuracy metrics: precision measures the per-
centage of true positive samples (true geo intent queries)
in the queries labeled by the classiﬁer to be positive (have
geo intent); recall measures the fraction of the true positive
samples detected by the classiﬁer in all the true positive sam-
ples; accuracy measures the percentage of the correct labels,
including both positive and negative ones, in the test set.
In this task, low precision will hurt users’ search experience
more than low recall or low accuracy. Thus a classiﬁer for

using diﬀerent classiﬁcation techniques and two sets of features. Precision, Recall and Accuracy are denoted
by P, R and Acc, respectively.

this task in a practical system should have high precision
and reasonably good accuracy and recall.

The evaluation results are shown in Table 4. We did not
test the performances of training MLGR and Treenet with
all features due to the high training cost. Results on the test-
ing subset I-1 show that : (1) all the classiﬁers perform well
by only using the low dimensional features (posteriors + low
dimensional GIU features) with precision, recall and accu-
racy values above 89%, 82% and 87% respectively. (2) using
all features can further improve precision while recall drops
about 14% and accuracy drops about 5%. (3) SVM-linear
achieves the highest precision on both feature sets; Treenet
achieves the highest recall by only using low dimensional
features; SVM-RBF achieves the highest accuracy by only
using low dimensional features. This result is expected since
linear classiﬁers do better with an increase in the number of
features in the presence of suﬃcient training data. Results
on the testing subset I-2, the harder task, show that : (1)
all the classiﬁers still perform reasonably well and achieve
precision values higher than 80% when only using low di-
mensional features except Treenet which has a precision of
78%. (2) using all features can improve all the metrics and
achieve high precision and reasonably good accuracy.

On both testing subsets, we achieve both high precision,
which is important for users’ satisfaction and good accuracy
although recall drops for the hard task. Thus, the geo city
language model features and GIU features can be used for
eﬀectively discovering users’ implicit city level geo intent.

As we know, the same web query can be issued by diﬀer-
ent users at diﬀerent time. Thus the web log samples from
two diﬀerent months may have considerable amount of the
identical queries. We do an overlap analysis in order to bet-
ter understand our evaluation results. We ﬁnd that in the
96.7M geo sub testing set (from the June’s sample), about
67% of the queries have appeared in the geo sub training set
(from the May’s sample). There are 28.9M and 29.2M dis-
tinct queries (Qnc) in the geo sub training and testing sets,
respectively. We ﬁnd about 48.06% of these distinct queries
(Qnc) of the geo sub testing set have appeared in the geo
sub training set. The overlap also reveals that many geo lan-
guage patterns found in old web query logs can be reused
because many geo queries appear repeatedly. This process
of splitting the training and test sets by time is a common
procedure in domains where the data occurs as a time series
4. In addition, there are plenty of new geo-queries, revealing
that our models can generalize well for new queries as well.
5.3 Evaluating Classiﬁer II

As shown in Figure 1, when Classiﬁer I has detected an
implicit city level geo intent query, the query will be passed

4http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/TDT/

to the second level classiﬁer – Classiﬁer II for analyzing the
query’s capability of being localized to the issuer’s IP loca-
tion. In this section, we describe the details of how we build
and evaluate Classiﬁer II.
5.3.1 Label Generation

We consider three predeﬁned categories: Local Geo quer-
ies or LG, Neighbor Region geo queries or NRG, and
remaining geo queries or RG, in §3 for this analysis. Our
low cost training set generation technique again utilizes the
geo sub training/testing sets where the non-city part
(Qnc) in the original data is used to create an implicit geo
intent query and the location part (Qc) is the city level label
corresponding to the geo intent. We then use the informa-
tion of distance L between the city level label (Qc) and the
issuer’s IP location to generate one of the above three sub-
category labels for each query.

To better understand the distribution of the distance L in
the geo queries, we divide L into 12 intervals and calculate
the number of the geo queries in the geo sub training set
(before and after we remove the duplicates) with distance
values in each interval. The results are shown in Figure 2.
It can be seen that a signiﬁcant portion of geo queries can
be localized to less than 50 miles from their issuers’ IP loca-
tions. A relatively small portion of geo queries can be local-
ized to a 50-100 miles radius from the issuers’ IP locations.
Many geo queries can hardly be localized. For representing
this diﬀerence, we generate a geo sub category label for each
query Q by ﬁrst collecting the distances, L = {L1...Ln},
(note that the same query may be issued by users with dif-
ferent IPs) and then calculate the median of these distances
(Lm = median(L)) and assigning Q to LG, NRG or RG
if Lm < 50, 50 ≤ Lm < 100, or Lm ≥ 100 (unit:miles),
respectively.

We generate a geo sub category label for each implicit geo
query (Qnc) in the geo sub training set, remove duplicates
and then randomly sample 15K implicit geo queries from
each of the three geo sub categories to form training subset
II. We then process the geo sub testing set in the same way
to obtain the testing subset II. To investigate the utility
of our geo features for discriminating between diﬀerent geo
sub categories, we design four classiﬁcation tasks : task A
– to discriminate between queries in LG and RG; task B –
to discriminate between queries in LG and NRG; task C –
to discriminate between queries in NRG and RG; task D –
to simultaneously discriminate between queries in all three
categories.

In this experiment, we again use SVM [5], Treenet and
MLGR [3], described in §5.2.2, for building Classiﬁer II.
The classiﬁer uses the same geo features, including the top-
10 city generation posteriors from the city language model
and the GIU features, for the four classiﬁcation tasks. We

also test the low and high training cost methods of using
geo features as described in §5.2.2. We separately scale
each feature dimension to be in the range [0,1] for all the
samples, and train the classiﬁer based on diﬀerent models
using data in training subset II for each of the four
tasks. We employ 5-fold cross validation to select model
parameters that achieve the highest average accuracy for
each task and test the optimized classiﬁer on the testing
subset II. Performance is evaluated by using accuracy as a
metric. Note that tasks A, B and C are binary classiﬁcation
tasks involving two labels while task D is a three-category
classiﬁcation task with three labels. The results are shown
in Table 5. Again when using all features, we only test the
performances of training SVM-linear and SVM-RBF.

We make the following observations: (1) Using low di-
mensional features (top-10 city generation posteriors + ag-
gregate GIU features), the model cannot easily discriminate
the subtle diﬀerences between LG (local geo queries) and
NRG (neighbor region geo queries), but can diﬀerentiate be-
tween LG and RG (not local or neighbor region geo queries),
and between NRG and RG, with reasonable accuracy (62.8%
by Treenet and 61.8% by SVM-RBF) (2) Using high dimen-
sional features greatly improves the accuracy to more than
96% using SVM-RBF even for the task of classifying all three
categories simultaneously (task D). This means that diﬀer-
ent geo sub categories indeed have diﬀerent GIUs and GIU
features. (3) Using all features in a non-linear model like
SVM-RBF performs better than a linear model, especially
for the three-category classiﬁcation task (task D). There-
fore, by using SVM-RBF and all geo features, Classiﬁer II

Table 6: Example of correct predictions of the city

can eﬀectively discriminate diﬀerent localization capabilities
of implicit geo queries’ to issuers’ IP locations. In this way
we can determine users’ speciﬁc geo intents. Note that al-
though training SVM-RBF with high dimensional data is
computationally expensive, the prediction cost is very low.
In addition, SVM-linear which has low training cost but rea-
sonably high accuracy (87%) is a good choice when oﬀ-line
training cost is a big issue.
5.4 Location-Speciﬁc Query Discovery

In this task we aim to ﬁnd queries with mentions of an en-
tity that is in some way speciﬁc to a particular geographic
location (in our case cities). Such “localized entities” may be
hotels, local tv and radio channels, local newspapers, uni-
versities, schools, people names like doctors, sports teams
and so on. Basically if a location (city/town level) can be
pinpointed to some item mentioned in the query, then the
query is a location-speciﬁc query, by our deﬁnition. Exam-
ples of a location speciﬁc query and corresponding locations
are shown in Table 6.
5.4.1 Label Generation

We evaluate our city language models for retrieving cities
in location-speciﬁc queries in this experiment. One impor-
tant property of location-speciﬁc queries is that although
explicit geo information is missing one may still accurately
discover the exact location (city/town level) in the user’s
mind, e.g. “Liberty Statue” or “Disney ﬂ” can be viewed as
location-speciﬁc queries, which are highly likely to be related
to New York or Orlando respectively. Our low-cost training
method again utilizes the non-city part (Qnc) of explicit geo
queries as implicit geo intent queries, and tries to discover
possible location-speciﬁc queries from them. This approach
has another advantage that the city part (Qc) can be used as
the ground truth city label for automatic evaluation. Since
it is extremely expensive to hire human editors to examine
over hundred million implicit geo-queries (Qnc) with their
city labels (Qc) and identify all the possible location-speciﬁc

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: Search / Session: Query Categorization488queries to create training and testing data, we ﬁrst utilize
the following weakly supervised approach combined with the
city language models for this discovery task, and then sam-
ple outputs of the city language models on the testing data
for human evaluation.

i

i

Our weakly supervised approach ﬁnvolves designing a few
ad hoc rules to ﬁnd the GIUs that may come from location-
speciﬁc queries. For example, we require that the maximum
city generation posterior –P (Cm|wi+n−1
) – be larger than
a threshold, t1, and the corresponding maximum frequency
count, #(wi+n−1
, Cm), be larger than a threshold t2; as an-
other example of our rules, we either require that wi+n−1
appear in less than a threshold, t3, number of cities or its
overall counts in the geo queries divided by the number of
city: #(wi+n−1
, C•)/#(|C•|) is larger than a threshold t4.
These rules are constructed by considering the characteris-
tics of the GIU features that location-speciﬁc queries may
have, and the thresholds are set by looking through the
GIUs (wi+n−1
) and their GIU feature values in the train-
ing data. We leave the question of how to automatically
generate these rules for future work. In this way, from the
geo sub training set we obtain 1022 unigram GIUs, 4374
bigram GIUs and 3765 trigram GIUs that may come from
location-speciﬁc queries. We then select queries, which con-
tain any of these GIUs, in the geo sub training/testing sets.
In this way we form training subset III/testing subset
III, each of which contains about 1.06M and 1.05M possible
distinct location-speciﬁc queries (distinct Qncs) respectively.
We use these automatically generated training and testing
subsets to automatically tune parameters for our task. We
now describe how to utilize city language models to further
discover cities for location-speciﬁc queries from these two
subsets.
5.4.2 City Language Models for Retrieving Candi-

date locations

Discovering missing related cities for location-speciﬁc queries

can be viewed as a challenging multi-category classiﬁcation
task, in which there are 1614 diﬀerent categories (city la-
bels). Given a query (Q) which has implicit geo-intent and
is location-speciﬁc, we calculate the city generation poste-
rior P (Ck|Q) of each city Ck by using city language models
(CLM) and equation 5. Then we sort these posteriors and
get the corresponding ranked list of cities. We check whether
the maximum posterior P (Cm|Q) is larger than a threshold
ta:
if yes, Cm is suggested as a candidate location for the
location speciﬁc query Q. Next, we discuss how to tune ta
with the training subset III.

We utilize the city part (Qc) as the ground truth city label
for each query (remember that the implicit geo-query, Q, is
the non-city part, Qnc, of a query in the logs), and calculate
precision and recall metrics to roughly evaluate the CLM’s
performance and tune ta. Speciﬁcally, given a query Q, we
retrieve a set of cities {Ck|P (Ck|Q) > ta}. When the ground
truth city label (Qcm ) is the same as the city (Cm) that has
the largest value of P (Cm|Q) > ta, we count that as a right
decision made by the CLM in the counter N1; but if Cm
is diﬀerent from its ground truth city label Qcm , we count
that as a wrong decision by the CLM, using the counter
N2. We then calculate the precision P , and recall R by
P = N1
N , where N denotes the number
of queries in the training subset III. Intuitively, P measures
the percentage of exactly right location suggestions for the
suggested good location-speciﬁc queries, and R measures the

percentage of suggested good location-speciﬁc queries in all
the possible location-speciﬁc queries.

Figure 3 shows the precision/recall curve with diﬀerent ta
values on the training subset III. It can be observed that by
choosing ta = 0.7 we can maintain reasonably high precision
(P = 92%) while the recall (R = 84.4%) does not drop too
much. We follow the same procedure to apply CLM on
testing subset III where it achieves precision of 88%, and
recall of 74% at the threshold of ta = 0.7.

To further evaluate the quality of the ranked list of cities
sorted by P (Cm|Q) , for each query (Qnc) that is a location-
speciﬁc query, we also compute an IR style measure called
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is the average of the
reciprocal of the ranks of the correct answers to the queries
in the testing data: M RR = P
r(Q) , where r(Q) denotes
Q

the rank position of the ground truth city label (Qc) of the
location speciﬁc query, Q. The higher the MRR, the closer
the correct answer’s rank position is to the top. When the
correct label (Qc) is at rank 1 for all location speciﬁc queries
(Q), the M RR = 1. By setting ta = 0.7, we have an M RR
of 0.951 on training subset III and M RR of 0.929 on testing
subset III. These high M RRs imply that for location-speciﬁc
queries, the true city labels appear nearly at the top of the
suggested city rank list. In this way we use the training and
testing subsets to tune the threshold ta.

The above promising results, especially the high preci-
sion and M RR, show that city language models can ef-
fectively suggest good location-speciﬁc queries and discover
missing city labels. Nevertheless, our rules to discover possi-
ble location-speciﬁc queries may be noisy and the automatic
evaluation using (Qc) as the ground truth city label is still
rough. Therefore, we design human evaluation experiments
to investigate the CLM’s performance by asking human edi-
tors to examine the quality of some sampled location-speciﬁc
queries and their city labels.
5.4.3 Human Evaluation

We sampled a random set of queries from testing subset
III, such that for each of these queries there existed at least
one city, C, that was predicted such that P (C|Q) > ta,
to obtain a set of 669 queries and 679 city predictions (10
queries have 2 predictions, the remaining have one). Af-
ter giving a detailed explanation of the task, we asked our
annotators two questions: (1) if the selected query was a
location speciﬁc query and (2) if the predicted location was
correct. Judges were asked to mark “Yes” or “No” in re-
sponse to these questions. Eleven judges judged at least 80
predictions each and 240 predictions were judged by 2 an-
notators. Annotators were allowed to mark a ‘?’ for either
of the two questions. They were also allowed to use a search
engine of their choice to better understand the meaning of

area of information retrieval. The annotators were a mix of
native and non-native speakers of English.

The inter-annotator agreement on our task was very high
(84.5 % on question (1) and 73% on question (2)). The dis-
agreement on question (2) was often for ambiguous queries
like “insider tv show cbs”, where one annotator considered
our prediction of “hollywood” as a location to be correct,
since that is the location of the CBS studios. Similarly the
query “city of angels tv.com” was a source of confusion, since
the location in the show is Los Angeles, but the show itself
is a national television show.

Of the queries that were marked location speciﬁc the accu-
racy of predicting a location was 84.5% 5, providing further
conﬁdence to support the rough evaluation of the previous
section. However, only half of the queries of the sampled
679 were marked as location speciﬁc. Some of the error may
be attributed to the explicit geo queries, obtained by using
the black-box tool [15], but the remaining was due to the
ad-hoc rules used for generating the data-sets used for pa-
rameter tuning. A cleaner data-set or better rules may help
improve the accuracy of prediction signiﬁcantly. Neverthe-
less even this noisy data set can be used to train parameters
with pretty high accuracy as we have seen.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We addressed the challenging task of automatically dis-
covering user’s speciﬁc geo intent in the web search at the
ﬁne-grained geo level – city/location level, even when the
explicit geo information is missing. We employ geo features
at ﬁne levels of granularity extracted from large scale web
search logs for this task. We propose two diﬀerent ways for
extracting geo features: one is through building city level geo
language models and calculating a query’s city generation
posteriors, the other one is through analyzing geo informa-
tion units and extracting rich GIU features at the city level.
These geo features are used for the construction of classiﬁers
in our geo intent analysis system, which detect and discover
users’ implicit geo intent at the city level, diﬀerentiate be-
tween diﬀerent localization capabilities of geo-intent queries,
and predict cities in location-speciﬁc queries.

For each individual step, we design a learning task for
evaluating the performance; and in each task, we use min-
imum human labeling eﬀort to supervise the data and la-
bel generation to automatically obtain large-scale learning
samples for training and testing. We leverage click-through
data as a surrogate for human labels. Experimental results
demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of using city language model
features and GIU features for all three learning tasks.

We can explore active learning approaches [17] to select a
relatively small number of samples for human judgment and
automatically learn better rules to get clean location-speciﬁc
query candidates, to generate more accurate CLMs. We can
also exploit other information in web search logs that may
help for this task, e.g. user clicks on the local modules of
the returned web pages given a query. We can also try to
build our models at a zip-code level to disambiguate between
locations that have the same name in the future. We can
also consider locations beyond the US for future work.

We can incorporate our city language models into retrieval
models. We are also interested in using the geo intent anal-
ysis results for helping to provide better query suggestions.
