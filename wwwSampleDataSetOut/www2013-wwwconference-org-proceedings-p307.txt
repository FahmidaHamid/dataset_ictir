ABSTRACT
Vibrant online communities are in constant ﬂux. As members
join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating fur-
ther changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic
change—in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the
norm—is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates indi-
vidual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity.
We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it hap-
pens and for understanding how speciﬁc users react to these evolv-
ing norms. By applying this framework to two large online commu-
nities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle
with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguisti-
cally innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language
of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users
stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by.

Building on this observation, we show how this framework can
be used to detect, early in a user’s career, how long she will stay
active in the community. Thus, this work has practical signiﬁ-
cance for those who design and maintain online communities. It
also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguis-
tic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and
individual-level linguistic change.

INTRODUCTION

“It takes a long time to become young.”

—Pablo Picasso

Online communities, such as online discussion forums or prod-
uct review websites, are constantly evolving. Norms of interaction
change over time, from domain-speciﬁc jargon [14] to conventions
for content attribution [20]. When new members join, they can
adapt to existing community norms, but can also push them in new
directions. Long-time members may adapt to these new norms or
they may be innovators themselves, setting new trends. Other users
may not react to changes, sticking to their previous styles.

Understanding the complex ways in which the interactional
styles of members and their communities jointly evolve over time is
essential for building and maintaining vibrant online communities.
Such conventions affect users’ decisions to actively participate in
the community and to contribute content [1, 31, 36] and are closely
related to the dynamics of member arrival and departure.

In this paper, we study these issues through the lens of the lan-
guage used by individual community members and by the commu-
nity at large. In particular, we investigate language change in the
sense of [11, 22, 25, 40, 43]: linguistic innovation originating in
a sub-group that becomes accepted as the norm through a process
of conforming. Such innovations facilitate individual expression
and help to create tight-knit sub-cultures. At the same time, the
process of conforming fosters cohesiveness within the group as a
whole. The evolving norms are thus a window into the broader
process of co-evolution of members and communities, serving to
differentiate newcomers from long-time members and conveying
information about the degree to which members remain engaged in
the community.

Summary of main contributions. We propose a framework for
tracking linguistic change and for understanding how speciﬁc users
react to evolving community norms at different stages of their lives
within their communities. We use this framework to study two
large, active online communities: RateBeer and BeerAdvocate.
Both sites are built around members evaluating and discussing beer.
They are excellent settings in which to study linguistic change:
both are more than a decade old, which gives us a long time win-
dow to work with; and both have extremely active memberships (it
is common for individuals to have written more than 100 reviews).
Moreover, both communities have also developed a rich set of con-
ventions and terminology.

In applying our framework to this data, we show that users follow
a determined lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguis-
tic change: early in her career, a user becomes increasingly recep-
tive to the norms of the community up to about one third of her
eventual lifespan, when she reaches a maximum synchrony with
the language of the community (we will call this early period lin-
guistic adolescence); from that point on, a gap between the user’s
language and that of the community forms and increases until the
moment she abandons the site. We show that this increasing gap is
explained by the user ceasing to respond to changes in community
norms: because the language of the community is constantly evolv-
ing a user that is unreceptive to this change will appear as fathering
from the community.

(a) ‘Aroma’ was the dominant convention
by 2003, but it was supplanted by ‘S’ (for
‘Smell’) around 2007.

(b) Users who joined in 2003 hung on to
the ‘Aroma’ convention of their youth.

(c) Users who joined in 2005 were more re-
ceptive to the emerging ‘S’ norm.

Figure 1: Example of community and user evolution in BeerAdvocate: one norm for referring to the smell of a beer gave way to
another, with different effects on different users depending on when they joined the community.

This pattern is surprisingly consistent, with users following the
same lifecycle pattern regardless of how much time or effort they
actually spent in the community. Long time contributors and short
term users follow the same pattern, with the latter evolving at an ac-
celerated pace. Crucially, this means that at the moment they depart
from the community most users are linguistically conservative.

Building on these observations, we show that a user’s patterns of
linguistic change can be harnessed to make predictions about her
membership in the community (Section 4). Inspired by our empir-
ical analysis, we design features that capture the speed at which a
member conforms to community norms along with other linguistic
change patterns, and use them in simple machine learning models.
We ﬁnd that, using solely the language of the ﬁrst few initial re-
views, we can predict a user’s total lifetime in the community. Our
models give signiﬁcant performance improvement over a baseline
model that is based on traditional activity based features [9]. Our
results thus have practical signiﬁcance for designers and maintain-
ers of online communities, who can use them to detect early in a
user’s career how long she will stay active in the community.

Implications for social networks and sociolinguistics research.
This work also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of
linguistic norms and the complex interplay between community-
level and individual-level linguistic change, addressing important
open questions in the social network and sociolinguistic literature.
There is extensive research covering the evolution of online com-
munities [21, 28], the evolution of community members [2, 10, 16,
29, 32], and their participation patterns [1, 3, 26, 30, 31, 48] (see
Section 6 for a discussion). But little is known about the interplay
between user-level evolution and the evolution of the community at
large, an issue which is the crux of this work.

This interplay is also a central open research question in linguis-
tics. Much sociolinguistic research has relied on the adult language
stability assumption: under the critical assumption that individuals’
speech patterns are largely ﬁxed by early adulthood, older speak-
ers’ language can be employed as a proxy for the linguistic state of
the community at an earlier stage [11, 12, 22, 23, 37, 42]. How-
ever, studies have also shown that this assumption can fail to hold.
For instance, individuals might change their language as they age,
while the community as a whole remains stable; or a change might
be simultaneously adopted by all members of the community, or
just by older members [25, 39, 40, 46, 47]. Distinguishing among
scenarios like these has proved to be a fundamental challenge in so-

ciolinguistics research [43]. Our framework opens up new avenues
for the studying of these issues in highly dynamic communities,
and our results show how the adult language stability assumption
and other theoretical models of linguistic change apply to online
settings (see Section 5 for a detailed discussion).

Linguistic change: An example. The bulk of this paper is ded-
icated to developing a framework for tracking the aggregate ef-
fects of numerous, ever-evolving linguistic changes. Not all of
these changes are intuitively accessible; like the phonological ef-
fects primarily studied by linguists working in ofﬂine communities,
the changes are often difﬁcult to identify and characterize individ-
ually. Thus, in what follows, we rely on quantitative evidence and
high-level evaluations to assess our framework. Nonetheless, many
of the linguistic changes at work in our data are highly intuitive and
easy to discern. It is illustrative to review one of them, before we
move to studying them at a more abstract level. The themes of this
example play out many times over in experiments to come.

Because our communities are built around beer, the discussion
frequently turns to assessing various aspects of the beer-tasting ex-
perience, so this is a locus of linguistic change at the lexical level.
One prominent example concerns smell. Over the life of the Beer-
Advocate community, there were two prominent conventions used
to introduce discussions of smell: Aroma and S (short for ‘Smell’).
Figure 1(a) summarizes the basic trend for this linguistic variable:
the Aroma convention (blue, thinner line) rose quickly in popularity
between 2001 and 2003, when it reached its peak. Around 2003,
the S convention (green) began its rise in popularity. The Aroma
convention lost ground quickly and was soon overtaken by S.

Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show that this linguistic change affected
old users differently than it affected new ones. Users who joined
the site in 2003, at the height of the Aroma boom, were very un-
likely to switch to S (Figure 1(b)). Indeed, they make hardly any
use of S (green), and even increase their use of Aroma (blue), pos-
sibly as a reaction to the encroaching norm and the social changes
it potentially signals [47]. The picture is very different for users
who joined in 2005, when S was taking off. Figure 1(c) suggests
that these new users are drivers of this change; their S usage rises
sharply while their Aroma usage starts and remains low.

We turn now to deﬁning our framework for tracking such
changes systematically, seeking to use it to understand the social
dynamics of a community and connect them with individual mem-
bers’ behaviors.

In the following we ﬁrst describe our dataset and then proceed to
discuss some of the details of the methodology used for our anal-
yses. In particular, here we focus on speciﬁc issues pertaining to
using language models to model linguistic change in longitudinal
data, leaving the bulk of the framework description to Section 3.

Community data. The framework presented in this paper is tar-
geted at large and active online communities, where individuals
interact through written text visible to all members of the commu-
nity. For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two
large beer review communities (BeerAdvocate and RateBeer).1 In
both communities users provide ratings accompanied by short tex-
tual reviews of more than 60,000 different types of beer. As we ar-
gue next, BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that
make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change. Statistics
of the two datasets are given in Table 1.

Table 1: Statistics of BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.

We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and
RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site [33], span-
ning a period of more than 10 years—from 2001 until 2011. Thus,
one of the main advantages of our datasets is the availability of the
entire community history; this not only means that they provide
complete longitudinal information for each user, but also that lin-
guistic conventions can be tracked back to their initial introduction
(we have already discussed two examples of such conventions in
the Introduction).

Another reason why these datasets are suitable for our purposes
is that users commonly contribute substantially to the community
(e.g., more than 4,700 users wrote at least 50 posts) and this be-
comes particularly important when tracking the patterns of linguis-
tic change over the lifespan of a user. Furthermore, since both com-
munities were active for over a decade, we can observe multiple
generations of users simultaneously, and therefore discard exter-
nal effects. Lastly, these communities are united by a very speciﬁc
purpose—the appreciation of beer—which makes for a fertile envi-
ronment for linguistic innovation.

User lifespan. Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and
RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user
base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer. This
presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to study linguistic
change over users’ entire lifespans, from the moment they joined
the community—which we deﬁne as the time of their ﬁrst post2—
to the moment they abandon the community. We consider that a
user abandoned the community if she did not contribute any post
for at least one year. In all experiments involving a user’s com-
plete lifespan we ignore users that have posted on or after January
2011 in order to enforce this policy (the last month covered by our

2We do not consider passive members to be linguistically active.
Studying the eventual effects of lurking on language use is an in-
teresting direction for future work.

datasets is December 2011). Figure 2 shows a breakdown of active
users showing the number of users joining and abandoning the two
communities each year, revealing their highly dynamic user bases.

Snapshot language models. In order to relate a user’s language
to that of the community, we require a reliable model of the lin-
guistic state of the community at various points in time. For that
purpose we use of a series of snapshot language models, one for
each month in the life of the community. These are bigram lan-
guage models with Katz back-off smoothing3 [17] estimated from
a held-out subset of posts from each month (posts which are not
used in any of the subsequent analyses).4 Given a post p, we can
then quantify how surprising its language is with respect to the lan-
guage the community was using at the point in time when it was
written by calculating p’s cross-entropy according to the snapshot
language model SLMm(p) of the month m(p) in which the post was
uttered; we write this as

H(p,SLMm(p)) =  

1
N Â

i

logPSLMm(p) (bi),

where b1, ...,b N are the bigrams making up p and PSLMm(p) (bi) is
the probability of the bigram bi under the snapshot language model
of the post’s month m(p). Higher cross-entropy values indicate
posts that deviate the most from the linguistic state of the commu-
nity at that particular point in time.

Controlling for length effects. Longer posts inherently have
larger cross-entropy and are more likely to contain elements of lin-
guistic innovation. Currently there is no consensus on a reliable
method for normalizing entropy measures in order to completely
account for length effects. In order to ensure that our results are
not affected by such effects, we only consider for our analysis the
ﬁrst k = 30 words of each post (unless otherwise mentioned). We

3We smooth the unigram back-off distribution using Laplace (ad-
ditive) smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.2.
4The held-out sample of posts comes from random selection of 500
users active that month, each user contributing exactly 2 posts to
the sample. This way all language models are trained on the same
amount of data each month (i.e., 1000 posts), and no user is over-
represented. None of the sampled posts used to train the snapshot
language models are ever used in any analysis (or prediction task).
All analysis involving the use of snapshot language models will be
restricted to the years 2004 through 2011, such that sufﬁcient data
is available for training.

stable across multiple choices of k.

3. USER LIFECYCLE AS REVEALED BY

LINGUISTIC CHANGE

We proceed by describing a framework for tracking linguistic
change in online communities and by discussing the insights this
framework offers on the interplay between user and community
evolution. In this section, we investigate some of the basic princi-
ples that govern the processes at work. We group this analysis into
two parts: (1) user-level evolution and community-level evolution
(Section 3.1); and (2) the interplay between these two as revealed
by the way users react to community-level linguistic changes at
different stages of their community life (Section 3.2). In these two
parts, we identify some basic and recurring phenomena that we will
show to be useful when developing techniques for a prediction task
with high practical importance—detecting, early in a user’s career,
how long she will stay active in the community (Section 4). We
will then discuss how the observed behavioral patterns relate to,
and bring new insights into, issues central to the sociolinguistic lit-
erature on linguistic change (Section 5).
3.1 User-level and community level change

Online communities are dynamic entities, with a constantly
changing user base. As such, these entities can not simply be de-
ﬁned as the sum of their active users. For example, out of the 662
users that joined the BeerAdvocate community in 2003, eight years
later in 2011 only 16% were still active; however, the other 84%
that were gone by 2011 helped deﬁne the collective identity of the
community as it stands today, with linguistic norms outliving their
forefathers. From the perspective of linguistic change, it is non-
trivial to separate changes that occur at community-level and those
that happen at the individual user-level. We start our investigations
by discussing these two levels separately.

User-level change. After joining a community, a user will likely
change her interaction and communication patterns. Rather than
capturing speciﬁc individual changes in user behavior we are inter-
ested in capturing the overall change in user’s language over time.
However, for the sake of concreteness we provide examples of two
speciﬁc examples of individual user change. Figure 3(a) shows how
user’s usage of singular ﬁrst-person pronouns (I, me, mine, myself )
decreases as the user contributes more reviews. This phenomenon
might be attributable to a user’s increasing identiﬁcation with the
community [5, 41]. In the same spirit, Figure 3(b) shows an in-
crease in usage of beer speciﬁc vocabulary as the members gain
experience in the community. As the user spends more time with
the community, they adopt and start using the speciﬁc language of
the community.

Community-level change. In a way similar to the evolution of
individual users whole communities also evolve. Despite the con-
stant change of community’s user base, the community also forms
an entity with a linguistic trajectory of its own. We have already
discussed the example of the two community-level changes in the
Introduction: the Smell and Aroma conventions that rise and fall
over time (Figure 1(a)).

Figure 4 shows another example of community-level language
change: The BeerAdvocate community becomes more “fruity” (us-
ing a vocabulary of 100 fruit words) over time. Even when we
control for a change in the distribution of the products reviewed by
macro-averaging by product, and by considering only those which

(a) First person sing. pronouns

(b) Beer speciﬁc vocabulary

Figure 3: Examples of user-level language change: (a) Percent-
age of posts containing ﬁrst person singular pronouns; (b) Per-
centage of reviews using specialized beer vocabulary (retention,
carbonation, lacing, etc.). The ﬁrst 100 posts of all users that
contributed at least 100 posts over their lifespan are considered
(so each user is represented exactly once in every bin). Results
for BeerAdvocate are shown here; same trends hold for Rate-
Beer. Throughout this paper, error bars indicate standard er-
ror estimated by bootstrap resampling [18].

Figure 4: Example of community-level change: The usage of
fruit words (e.g., peach, pineapple, berry) increases on BeerAd-
vocate. (Same trend holds for RateBeer.)

were reviewed each year, we observe a signiﬁcant increase in the
usage of fruit words to describe the taste and feel of a particular
beer. This means that while the products are not changing the com-
munity’s language to describe them changes over time.

Next we also examine the community change at a more aggre-
gate level. In Figure 5 (blue, round markers) we examine the cross-
entropy of each month’s posts, according to the snapshot language
model of the respective month. We make several observations.
First, the cross-entropy ﬂuctuates over time, which means that the
community language is not static but it also evolves on an aggregate
level. Second, the cross-entropy decreases as the community ages,
which means that the posts written in the later years employ more
predictable language. Moreover, this decrease in cross-entropy also
suggests that evolving community norms can lead to group cohe-
siveness and the creation of a collective identity. Last, we also note
that users that just joined use language that is less predictable and
thus less aligned with the current state of the community (green,
diamond markers).

The question thus arises: what is the trajectory of a user’s adap-
tation to the community norms as she transitions from being a new-
comer to being an established member of the community. We in-
vestigate this next.

their community-life in a way that allows comparison across users
with different activity levels and lifespans.

To this end we deﬁne the life-stage of a user as the percentage of
posts the user has already written, out of the total number of posts
the user will ultimately write before abandoning the community.5
Thus, a life-stage of 0% corresponds to birth—the moment the user
joined the community—and a life-stage of 100% corresponds to
death—the moment the user leaves the community.

●

User’s distance from the language of the community. Another
key element of the proposed framework is the ability to mea-
sure a user’s reaction to linguistic change at a given stage in her
community-life. In the following we use several measures for lin-
guistic change, each of them providing different perspectives on the
phenomenon. We start by quantifying the extent to which a user is
in tune with the community’s norms by employing the snapshot
language models deﬁned in Section 2.

In Figure 6 we plot the average cross-entropy of a user’s posts
at different life-stages according to the snapshot language model
of the months in which the respective posts were written. Observ-
ing the evolution of cross-entropy over the users’ lifespan we no-
tice that, in both communities under study, users follow a deter-
mined lifecycle: When users join, their language is far from that
of the community6 (high cross-entropy) and then users gradually
approach the current language of the community (decreasing cross-
entropy); interestingly, after about a third of users (ultimate) lifes-
pan, their language starts to again distance itself from that of the
community. It appears as if a user’s language falls out of tune with
that of the community before she abandons the community.

Since communities as well as individuals simultaneously evolve,
it is not clear whether the change in cross-entropy we just described
is the result of the user actively changing her language towards (and
then away) from that of the community or, on the contrary, the
result of the evolving community norms getting closer (respectively
away) from a static user. Thus, the increase in cross-entropy in the
end stage of user’s lifetime could be explained by two competing
hypotheses:

ity of each month’s language, calculated as the average cross-
entropy of that month’s posts according to snapshot language
model of the respective month (blue, round markers; error bars

ier to predict’. Compare with the predictability of the language
used by users joining that month (green, diamond markers).

3.2 User lifecycle

We now transition from exploring user-level and community-
level linguistic change in isolation to the main goal of the present
work: Building a framework for understanding the interaction be-
tween these levels of change. In particular, we focus on analyzing
a user’s susceptibility to react to the evolving norms of the commu-
nity at different stages of her community life.

User life-stage. One of the challenges for an analysis that operates
at both the community and the individual user level is the relativ-
ity of time. Unlike the ofﬂine settings where traditional studies of
linguistic change were conducted, in online setting individuals in-
teract with the community at very different rates. Moreover, online
users have vastly different lifespans, ranging from one day to an
entire decade. Therefore, it is important to identify a user’s stage in

• The user is moving away from the community by starting to
use language that is foreign to the current state of the com-
munity.

• The user stops adapting her language to the community and

gets out of tune with the changing community.

In order to tease these two hypotheses apart, we measure how much
a user’s language changes with respect to her own past language
at each stage of her life. More precisely, we compare the lexi-
cal overlap between each post and the previous 10 posts written
by the same user according to the Jaccard similarity coefﬁcient7.
Figure 7(a) shows that on average users increasingly stabilize their
language for the ﬁrst third of their lifespan (henceforth linguistic
5In order to keep a meaningful interpretation to this fractional mea-
sure, in all experiments that involve it we ignore users with less than
50 posts. However, the same qualitative results hold if this limit is
not enforced.
6More precisely, “far from the state of the community at the time
the post was written”:
the cross-entropy of each post p is com-
puted with respect to a community language model SLMm(p) con-
temporary with the post; this is crucially different from comparing
the post with a time-invariant model of the community language
since it accounts for the community-level language volatility we
have discussed.
7We obtain the same qualitative trend for other lexical overlap mea-
sures such as cross-entropy and cosine-similarity.

adolescence) and then their language rigidiﬁes. This supports the
second hypothesis: Early in their career users learn and adapt to the
language of their community, but over time they stop conforming
and the community slowly drifts away from them.

Users get stuck in the past. In order to gain further insight into
the relation between a user’s language at each life-stage and that of
the community, we use the concept of linguistic progressiveness,
which we deﬁne next. For each post p we consider the snapshot
language models for the 12 months previous to the one in which p
was written and the snapshot language models for the 12 months
after that; we will denote with SLMi the language model corre-
sponding to the i-th month after (or, if i is negative, before) the
month p was written. We then deﬁne the linguistic progressiveness
of p as:

Prog(p) = argmin

 12i12,i6=0

H(p,SLMi),

where H(p,SLMi) is the cross-entropy of p with respect to the
SLMi language model. Under this notation, Prog(p) =  3 would
mean that the language of the post p appears to closest to the lan-
guage used in the third month before p was written. A negative
value of Prog(p) indicates that p uses conservative language (in the
sense that p uses language that looks like the language used in the
past), while a positive value indicates progressive language. Fig-
ure 7(b) shows that users employ increasingly progressive language
through their linguistic adolescence and then use language that is
more and more past-leaning. This behavior has tight connections
with the adult language stability assumption from sociolinguistics,
and we will expand on these connections in Section 5.

User’s reaction to lexical innovation. While our cross-entropy
based measures are suitable to measure the linguistic distance from
the community, the results remain opaque with respect to the ac-
tual actions through which users react to new community norms.

Table 2: Examples of lexical innovations.

This motivates further investigation of a speciﬁc form of linguistic
change, namely lexical innovation. As we have already discussed,
the vocabulary of the community is in continuous ﬂux with new
words being constantly introduced in the community. Some of the
new words will be adopted by the community and become lexical
innovation. For the purpose of this study, a lexical innovation is
a word that was never used before in the community and that was
used at least 10 times by multiple users in posts discussing differ-
ent products8 over a period of 6 months after the word was ﬁrst
used. This way we ﬁlter out words that did not get picked up by
the community and words that are user- or product-idiosyncratic.
Lexical innovations include conventions (such as the ones already
discussed), descriptive terms (such as fruit-words) and other types
of words; using this methodology an average of 97 lexical innova-
tions were identiﬁed each month, some of which are provided in
Table 2 as examples.

We investigate the adoption of new words over the user’s lifetime
in Figure 7(c), which shows the probability of a user adopting lex-
ical innovations introduced in the 3 months preceding her post, at
each life-stage; we observe once again that the reaction to linguis-
tic norms follows a lifecycle: users initially increase their rate of
assimilation, which peaks at the end of their linguistic adolescence,
and then follows a decreasing trend until the moment of abandon-
ment. Figure 7(c) also shows that even though it is in the “just
joined” stage when a users’ language is farthest from that of the
community (leftmost part of Figure 6) and when the ﬂexibility of
their language is at its height (leftmost part of Figure 7(a)), users
are actually most receptive to lexical innovations (i.e., words that
are not only new to the user, but also to the community) at the peak
of their linguistic adolescence.

Elastic lifecycle: “All users die old”. All experiments described
thus far suggest the following lifecycle: After an initial period of
adaptation to the language of their community— which we called
linguistic adolescence in order to maintain analogy with the ofﬂine
case— individuals’ language patterns slowly rigidify until the mo-
ment they abandon the community. These ﬁndings conﬁrm that the
adult language stability assumption, central to much of the soci-
olinguistic work on linguistic change, holds in the online domain
(see Section 5 for a detailed discussion of the implications of our
ﬁndings for sociolinguistics). However, our framework also reveals
a crucial difference from ﬁndings in ofﬂine settings: the moment
when linguistic adolescence ends— and the user is at a peak lin-
guistic harmony with the community—is not bound to an absolute
or biological time-frame, but instead is relative to the users’ own
ultimate lifespan. To illustrate this we show in Figure 8 the lexi-
cal innovation lifecycle for individuals with different lifespans (i.e.,
different total number of contributed posts). Each curve is obtained
by applying the methodology used for Figure 7(c) to sets of users
with different lifespan intervals (a non-normalized x-axis is used in
order to allow comparisons between the curves).

8Here we are even stricter, by requiring the lexical innovations to
appear in reviews for products that come from different producers.

Focusing on Figure 8 brings three interesting points. First we
observe that, in spite of having vastly different lifespans, users fol-
low a similar shape in their lifecycle: an increase in the adoption of
linguistic innovation followed by a decreasing trend.

Second, the moment of maximum receptiveness to lexical inno-
vations (i.e., the end of linguistic adolescence) is not ﬁxed (at, say,
around 60 posts), but rather it is a function of the ultimate lifespan
of the user. Therefore we say that the linguistic lifecycle is “elas-
tic”, in the sense that it stretches according to the ultimate lifespan
of the user. All users appear to go through the same life-stages with
the only difference that users that are eventually going to contribute
more posts to the community end their linguistic adolescence after
a larger number of reviews. A way to summarize this ﬁnding is to
say that users generally die “linguistically old” (i.e., at a stage when
they have relatively little reaction to linguistic change), no matter
if they contribute relatively few posts to the community, or if they
are heavy contributors.

Lastly, by comparing the heights of the curves in Figure 8, we
can see that the level of receptivity to changing norms is also cor-
related with the ultimate lifespan of the user. Users that will even-
tually contribute more posts to the community start (and stay) at a
higher level of receptivity than users that will eventually contribute
less.

We also point out that the same observations regarding the elas-
ticity of a user’s lifecycle hold when we repeat the same type of
split-group analysis for all other measures of linguistic change we
have discussed: distance from the community, user-language ﬂex-
ibility, and linguistic progressiveness; they also hold in both com-
munities.

These observations are surprising since they suggest that infor-
mation about the ultimate lifespan of a user is encoded in the pat-
terns of linguistic change exhibited in her early career; for exam-
ple, if a user begins rigidifying her language after writing only 20
posts, it is unlikely that she will contribute 200 more posts before
abandoning the community. In what follows we will harness these
insights in the setting of a prediction task.

tions at each life-stage, comparing users with different lifespans

3134. LINGUISTIC CHANGE AS A PREDIC-

TOR OF USER LIFESPAN

We have so far concentrated on identifying and characterizing
the principles governing linguistic change in our online commu-
nities. We turn now to showing that these principles are predic-
tive of whether a new member will soon abandon a community.
Since communities thrive only if new members are able to establish
themselves, this task has practical value for cultivating and main-
taining vibrant online communities; the ability to identify speciﬁc
groups of at-risk members early on can give community maintain-
ers a chance to re-involve them in the community.

Our primary goal in formulating the prediction task is to use it as
an example on how information about user- and community-level
linguistic phenomena can inform some of the questions relevant to
the maintenance of online communities. As such, the task is struc-
tured to explore relative performance gains from different types of
information, rather than for optimizing raw performance per se.
Overall, we hope to to contribute to a broader understanding of the
process of linguistic change in online communities. In what fol-
lows, we show that features based on this new understanding lead
to performance on the prediction task that improves signiﬁcantly
over a natural baseline. The results discussed next suggest that fea-
tures based on a user’s early linguistic change patterns can provide
important information about that user’s ultimate lifespan.

Deﬁnition of the predictive task. We deﬁne our task as predict-
ing, for each user, whether she is among the ‘departed’ or the ‘liv-
ing’. We make these predictions based only on features extracted
from each user’s ﬁrst w posts, for a small w (e.g., w = 20). A user
is in the ‘departed’ class if she abandoned the community before
writing m more posts for a small m (e.g., m = 30); we call the inter-
val [w,w +m] the departed range. A user is ‘living’ if she stayed in
the community long enough to write n posts for a relatively large n
(e.g., n = 200); we call the interval [n,•] the living range.

Features used for learning. Our features are informed and de-
signed based on the ﬁndings we reported in the previous sections.
Our aim here is to illustrate the space of features that arise from
these ﬁndings. To this end we consider the following ﬁve simple
post-level features that we will then use to characterize a user’s pat-
terns of linguistic change:

• Cross-entropy: The average cross-entropy of the post accord-
ing to the snapshot language model of that month. The fea-
ture draws on the characteristic U-shape pattern in users’ lan-
guage evolution (Figure 6).

• Jaccard self-similarity: The Jaccard similarity of the current
post with the ten immediately preceding ones. This feature is
based on the results summarized by Figure 7(a) and attempts
to capture a user’s ﬂexibility to adapt to linguistic change.

• Adoption of lexical innovations. This feature takes value 1 if
the post contains a lexical innovation introduced in commu-
nity in the previous three months, and 0 otherwise. The fea-
ture is based on ﬁndings summarized by Figure 8 and aims
to model a user’s receptiveness towards lexical innovations.
• First-person singular pronouns: This feature takes value 1 if
the post contains a ﬁrst-person singular pronoun, and 0 oth-
erwise. The feature is inspired by the analysis in Figure 3,
where we found that, over time, users employ fewer ﬁrst-
person singular pronouns and by previous work suggesting
that this decline can mark a sense of afﬁliation with a com-
munity [5, 41].

• Number of words: The number of words of the review. Gen-
erally, we found that long-term contributors tend to write
longer reviews.

We use these post-level features to construct user-level features
that capture linguistic change patterns. Because our generalizations
concern the evolution of styles and linguistic norms, all of the user-
level features take a common form: we divide the w observed posts
into (temporally) consecutive bins of size 5 and extract for each bin
the averages of each of the the ﬁve post-level features discussed
above. In addition, for each of the ﬁve types of features we deﬁne
a feature that indicates the bin with the maximum value9. Thus, for
example, ‘Adoption of lexical innovation’ determines a family of
user-level features [LexicalInnovation1, . . . , LexicalInnovationw/5]
giving the average lexical innovation rate of the posts in each bin,
along with another feature LexicalInnovationmax giving the index i
such that LexicalInnovationi is maximal for this family. Our goal
in using these features is to approximate the evolutionary processes
we sought to characterize earlier.

As a baseline we also include two very simple yet powerful ac-

tivity based family of features:

• Frequency: the average time between posts in each bin, as

well as the index of the bin with the maximum frequency.

• Month:

the month of the last review in each bin. These
features are included to account for changes in community-
wide abandonment rates (e.g., later years have a considerably
higher abandonment rate, as apparent in Figure 2).

We expect these features to have especially powerful predictive
value, as they directly relate to the target variable we aim to predict.
In a sense, these features are much more direct ways of establish-
ing user involvement. Moreover, prior work on user churn pre-
diction [9, 49] found activity-based features to be by far the most
powerful churn predictors. So any improvement brought by our
linguistic features over this strong baseline would indicate a strong
relation between a user’s linguistic change patterns and her ultimate
lifespan.

Experimental setup. Our models are binary logistic classiﬁers.
Table 3 summarizes our results for the task of predicting whether
a new user will stay in the community, for different choices of w
(the number of reviews we observe for each user), m (deﬁning the
departed range) and n (deﬁning the living range). The results re-
ported are averages over 20 random train-test data splits. Each split
used 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. We treat
BeerAdvocate as a ‘development domain’, because we used it for
developing the models and experimental setting, and RateBeer as a
‘test domain’ in which we validate our ﬁnal models on previously
unseen data.

Experimental results. Table 3 compares results for ‘activity-
only’ models with those for ‘full’ models (which include our ﬁve
linguistic change features in addition to the activity features). We
ﬁnd that our linguistically-motivated features give an additional
2–12% absolute (4–40% relative) improvement in F1 score over
the baseline activity-based features. Moreover, for each pairing of
results (values of w), our full model improves signiﬁcantly over the
activity-only model, according to a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank
test comparing the F1 scores from the 20 trials (p < 0.001).10
9For cross-entropy, the minimum value is selected instead, in con-
sideration of the U-shape pattern observed in Figure 6.
10Given that the train and test sets are sometimes highly imbalanced,
we favor evaluating these models using the F1 scores on the minor-

Feature analysis. To better understand the extend to which
these improvements are explained by the exploitation of linguis-
tic change patterns, we conduct a brief feature analysis of our full
logistic models. We ﬁnd that the learned coefﬁcients are in good
correspondence with the new insights brought forward in this work;
for example, the ‘departure class’ is characterized by negative co-
efﬁcients for LexicalInnovation1 (i.e., a low initial rate of adop-
tion of lexical innovation) as well as by negative coefﬁcients for
LexicalInnovationmax (i.e., an early end of the linguistic adoles-
cence stage), thus corresponding to the observations summarized
in Figure 8. Similar observations also hold for the cross-entropy
and self-similarity features.

Furthermore, we ﬁnd that each of the ﬁve families of linguis-
tic features bring improvements in performance when added incre-
mentally to the activity model (Table 4). At the same time, none of
the features can by themselves explain the improvement reported
in Table 3. This indicates that our linguistic change features com-
plement each other in predicting a user’s departure from the com-
munity.

ity class, which is also our target ‘departing’ class. For complete-
ness, we note that our models also compare favorably in terms of
accuracy when compared to the majority-class baseline. It should
be however emphasized that the accuracy one achieves with the
majority-class baseline would not translate well to a real world con-
text, where such model could only advise a community maintainer
that all or none of the community’s members were leaving. In con-
trast, our models provide actionable intelligence in that they could
help community maintainers to identify speciﬁc groups of at-risk
members and try to re-involve them in the community.

IMPLICATIONS FOR
SOCIOLINGUISTICS

The development of the framework discussed in Section 3 was
guided by a large body of sociolinguistic research concerning the
patterns of linguistic change in ofﬂine communities. However, we
do not simply use these results passively. Rather, we show that
studying very large online communities can lead to new linguis-
tic insights and we address challenging methodological issues con-
cerning how to track and measure change. Here we discuss how
our work relates to sociolinguistic research of language change in
ofﬂine communities.

In one of the earliest and most inﬂuential studies of linguis-
tic change [22], William Labov proposed the apparent time con-
struct: under the critical assumption that individuals’ speech pat-
terns are largely ﬁxed by early adulthood, older speakers’ lan-
guage can be employed as a proxy for the linguistic state of the
community at an earlier stage, thus providing the temporal fac-
tor necessary for studying linguistic change. This assumption,
called the adult language stability assumption, was supported by
numerous subsequent studies in a wide variety of social settings
[11, 12, 23, 37, 40, 42, 47], but it is widely acknowledged that it
could fail to hold in certain cases [25, 39, 46]. For instance, indi-
viduals might change their language as they age, while the com-
munity as a whole remains stable. Alternatively, a change might
be simultaneously adopted by all members of the community, or
just by older members. Distinguishing among scenarios like these
has proved to be a fundamental challenge over the last ﬁve decades
[43].

A priori, it is not at all obvious whether the adult language sta-
bility assumption suits the online world, where community-time is
warped, with drastic linguistic changes arising in very short pe-
riods of time (for example, the Twitter RT convention achieved
mainstream status in about two months [20]). Similarly, concepts
like adolescence and adulthood need to be redeﬁned to account
for the vastly different interaction rates characteristic of online set-
ting: members who interact within the community on a daily basis
are likely to mature faster than members who sign on only once a
month. Moreover, it has been suggested that adult language stabil-
ity has biological explanations [27], and therefore is tied to actual
biological aging, which is less relevant in the context of fast-paced
online communities.

Our framework conﬁrms that, in spite of these fundamental dif-
ferences, the adult language stability assumption does indeed hold

315in the online case: after an initial period of adaptation to the lan-
guage of the community, users’ linguistic patterns rigidify (Fig-
ure 7(a) in Section 3.2) and they become less likely to pick up on
new community norms (Figure 7(c) in Section 3.2); the language
of the “old” users is conservative and reﬂects the state of the com-
munity at an earlier stage (Figure 7(b) in Section 3.2).11 However,
our framework also reveals a crucial difference from the traditional
formulation: the end of the linguistic adolescence is not tied to an
absolute time frame, but is relative to the individual’s ultimate lifes-
pan (Figure 8 in Section 3.2). Our observations thus suggest that
biological explanations are probably not the main source of adult
language stability, and in general open up new avenues for the study
of linguistic change in adults in highly dynamic communities.

6. ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK

In addition to the sociolinguistic and other prior work discussed
above, our work draws from, and has implications for, many other
research threads.

Implications for interaction in online communities. A number
of early studies examined various ways in which norms arise in
group interactions, including the important roles of primacy (the
ﬁrst variant of some norm tends to persist), social status (norms
are often introduced by individuals with higher social capital) [13],
minimization of joint effort [6], as well as mechanisms like accom-
modation [15] and audience design [4] by which speakers adjust
their language toward that of their audience.

More recent studies have shown that similar mechanisms are at
work in online communities, revealing the emergence of linguistic
norms in e-mail [35], Twitter [7, 19, 20, 38, 45] and internet forums
[8, 14]. This paper demonstrates the link between such community
norms and the lifecycle of the individual user, showing how users
are most sensitive to new norms at early stages of their career.

Our work also draws on a study that showed how new users
change their language after joining a community, and demonstrated
that a machine learning classiﬁer could be trained to predict how
long a user had been in a community, given linguistic features like
self-introductions, references to other members, or mentions of the
name of the forum [34]. Our work gives a further understanding of
user change, by relating it to community change and to the entire
lifespan of the user. Also, by showing that we can further predict
how long a user will remain in the community, we extend the pre-
diction task literally into the future.

Implications for the dynamics of online communities. Our work
here also builds on a rich line of work studying online communities.
For example, previous research has examined the dynamics of on-
line social networks, studying the evolution of the whole network
structure [21, 28], of groups inside these networks [2, 10, 16, 50],
as well as the social tie creation between individual users [29].
While such studies focused on the evolution of individual compo-
nents (users, groups, communities) we recognize the need to study
social systems holistically. In particular, in this work we propose
the study of the interaction between the evolution of individual
users and that of the community at large.

11We also note that our results are also consistent with the stan-
dard sociolinguistic model of language change, Labov’s logistic-
incrementation model [24, 44], which claims that ‘a general re-
quirement of change in progress’ (2001, p. 455) is the occurrence
of a peak in adoption of linguistic innovation exactly before the
language system stabilizes—peak which we observe in Figure 7(c)
and Figure 8.

There has also been a rich line of research applying methods
from anthropology [48] and social psychology [30] to online com-
munities. Issues like lurking and free-riding [36] as well as reasons
for user participation in online communities [1, 26, 31] have been
studied using small scale interviews and data analysis. These stud-
ies have argued that factors like group size and posting volume,
newcomer status, linguistic complexity, as well as word choice, af-
fect an individual’s interaction with the community. We add an
important dimension to this line of work as we employ large scale
data analysis to better understand the evolution and lifecycle of in-
dividual users.
7. CONCLUSION

In this work we proposed a framework for tracking linguistic
change and for understanding how individual users react to evolv-
ing community norms at different stages of their careers. By ap-
plying this framework to two large online review communities we
studied the interaction between users-level and community-level
evolution over a decade. This revealed that users follow a de-
termined two-stage lifecycle: A linguistically innovative learning
phase in which users align with the language of the community,
followed by a conservative phase in which users stop responding to
changes in community norms. We have shown that understanding
patterns of linguistic change can bear practical importance for com-
munity maintainers, in that features inspired by our analysis can be
used to detect early in a user’s career how long she will stay active
in the community.

At a higher level, the goal of this work has been to provide the
foundations for reasoning about the co-evolution of users and their
communities. Our work opens a range of interesting questions both
in terms of sociolinguistics and of analysis of online communities.
In particular, it would be interesting to investigate how the pat-
terns of linguistic change are affected by engagement in multiple
communities, as well as how users that are members of multiple
communities transfer norms and conventions between communi-
ties. Furthermore, we anticipate that further analysis could poten-
tially suggest richer linguistically and socially informed methods
of identifying users that are likely to depart a community or predict
a user’s success in the community.
