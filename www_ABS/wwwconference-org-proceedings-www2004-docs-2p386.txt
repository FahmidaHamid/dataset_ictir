in this paper, we describe our work in progress on the reasoning module  of  ec(h)o,  an  augmented  audio-reality  interface  for museum visitors utilizing spatialized soundscapes and a semantic web approach to information. we used ontologies to describe the semantics  of  sound  objects  and  represent  user  model.  a  rule-based system for selecting sound object uses semantic description of  objects,  visitor s interaction  history  and  heuristics  for continuity of the dialogue between user and the system.
