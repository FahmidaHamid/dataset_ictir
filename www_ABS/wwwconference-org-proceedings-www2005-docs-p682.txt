as xquery is gathering momentum as the standard query language for xml, there is a growing interest in using it as an integral part of the xml application development infrastructure. in that context, one question which is often raised is how well xquery interoper-ates with other xml languages, and notably with xslt. xquery 1.0 [16] and xslt 2.0 [7] share a lot in common they share xpath 2.0 as a common sub-language and have the same expressiveness. however, they are based on fairly different programming paradigms. while xslt has adopted a highly declarative template based approach, xquery relies on a simpler, and more operational, functional approach. in this paper, we present an approach to compile xslt 2.0 into xquery 1.0, and a working implementation of that approach. the compilation rules explain how xslt s template-based approach can be implemented using the functional approach of xquery and underpins the tight connection between the two languages. the resulting compiler can be used to migrate a xslt code base to xquery, or to enable the use of xquery runtimes (e.g., as will soon be provided by most relational database management systems) for xslt users. we also identify a number of areas where compatibility between the two languages could be improved. finally, we show experiments on actual xslt stylesheets, demonstrating the applicability of the approach in practice.
