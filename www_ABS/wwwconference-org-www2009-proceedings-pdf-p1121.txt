the behavioral description based web service composition (wsc) problem aims at the automatic construction of a coordinator web service that controls a set of web services to reach a goal state. however, solving the wsc problem exactly with a realistic model is doubly-exponential in the number of variables in web service descriptions. in this paper, we propose a novel e cient approximation-based algorithm using automatic abstraction and re nement to dramatically reduce the number of variables needed to solve the problem.
