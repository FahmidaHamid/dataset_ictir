in  this  paper,  we  try  to  leverage  a  large-scale  and  multilingual knowledge  base,  wikipedia,  to  help  effectively  analyze  and organize  web  information  written  in  different  languages.  based on the observation that one wikipedia concept may be described by  articles  in  different  languages,  we  adapt  existing  topic modeling  algorithm  for  mining  multilingual  topics  from  this knowledge  base.  the  extracted   universal   topics  have  multiple types  of  representations,  with  each  type  corresponding  to  one language. accordingly, new documents of different languages can be represented in a space using a group of universal topics, which makes various multilingual web applications feasible.
