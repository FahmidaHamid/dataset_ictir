a  number  of  applications  require  selecting  targets  for  specific contents on the basis of criteria defined by the contents providers rather than selecting documents in response to user queries, as in ordinary  information  retrieval.  we  present  a  class  of  retrieval systems,  called  best  bets,  that  generalize  information  filtering and  encompass  a  variety  of  applications  including  editorial suggestions,  promotional  campaigns  and  targeted  advertising, such  as  google  adwords .  we  developed  techniques  for implementing  best  bets  systems  addressing  performance  issues for large scale deployment as efficient query search, incremental updates and dynamic ranking.
