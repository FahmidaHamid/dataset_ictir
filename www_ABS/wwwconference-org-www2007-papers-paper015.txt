the world wide web (www) is rapidly becoming important for society as a medium for sharing data, information and services, and there is a growing interest in tools for understanding collective behaviors and emerging phenomena in the www. in this paper we focus on the problem of searching and classifying communities in the web. loosely speaking a community is a group of pages related to a common interest. more formally communities have been associated in the computer science literature with the existence of a locally dense sub-graph of the web-graph (where web pages are nodes and hyperlinks are arcs of the web-graph). the core of our contribution is a new scalable algorithm for  nding relatively dense subgraphs in massive graphs. we apply our algorithm on web-graphs built on three publicly available large crawls of the web (with raw sizes up to 120m nodes and 1g arcs). the e ectiveness of our algorithm in  nding dense subgraphs is demonstrated experimentally by embedding arti cial communities in the web-graph and counting how many of these are blindly found. e ectiveness increases with the size and density of the communities it is close to 100% for communities of a thirty nodes or more (even at low density). it is still about 80% even for communities of twenty nodes with density over 50% of the arcs present. at the lower extremes the algorithm catches 35% of dense communities made of ten nodes. we complete our community watch system by clustering the communities found in the web-graph into homogeneous groups by topic and labelling each group by representative keywords.
