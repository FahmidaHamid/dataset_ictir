the  phenomenon  of  sponsored  search  advertising  is  gaining ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines. firms across different industries have are beginning to adopt this as the primary  form  of  online  advertising.  this  process  works  on  an auction  mechanism in  which  advertisers  bid  for  different keywords, and final rank for a given keyword is allocated by the search engine. but how different are firm s actual bids from their optimal bids? moreover, what are other ways in which firms can potentially  benefit  from sponsored search advertising? based on the  model  and  estimates  from  prior  work  [10],  we  conduct  a number  of  policy  simulations  in  order  to  investigate  to  what extent  an  advertiser  can  benefit  from  bidding  optimally  for  its keywords.  further,  we  build  a  hierarchical  bayesian  modeling framework to explore the potential for cross-selling or spillovers effects  from  a  given  keyword  advertisement  across  multiple product  categories,  and  estimate the model using markov chain monte  carlo  (mcmc)  methods.  our  analysis  suggests  that advertisers are not bidding optimally with respect to maximizing profits.  we  conduct  a  detailed  analysis  with  product  level variables  to  explore  the  extent  of  cross-selling  opportunities across different categories from a given keyword advertisement. we  find  that  there  exists  significant  potential  for  cross-selling through  search  keyword  advertisements  in  that  consumers  often end  up  buying  products  from  other  categories  in  addition to the product  they  were  searching  for.  latency  (the  time  it  takes  for consumer  to  place  a  purchase  order  after  clicking  on  the advertisement) and the presence of a brand name in the keyword are associated with consumer spending on product categories that are different from the one they were originally searching for on the internet.
