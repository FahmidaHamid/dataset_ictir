traditional information systems return answers after a user submits a complete query. users often feel  left in the dark  when they have limited knowledge about the underlying data, and have to use a try-and-see approach for  nding information. a recent trend of supporting autocomplete in these systems is a  rst step towards solving this problem. in this paper, we study a new information-access paradigm, called  interactive, fuzzy search,  in which the system searches the underlying data  on the  y  as the user types in query keywords. it extends autocomplete interfaces by (1) allowing keywords to appear in multiple attributes (in an arbitrary order) of the underlying data; and (2)  nding relevant records that have keywords matching query keywords approximately. this framework allows users to explore data as they type, even in the presence of minor errors. we study research challenges in this framework for large amounts of data. since each keystroke of the user could invoke a query on the backend, we need e cient algorithms to process each query within milliseconds. we develop various incremental-search algorithms using previously computed and cached results in order to achieve an interactive speed. we have deployed several real prototypes using these techniques. one of them has been deployed to support interactive search on the uc irvine people directory, which has been used regularly and well received by users due to its friendly interface and high e ciency.
