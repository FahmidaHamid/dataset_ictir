we study the problem of online team formation. we consider a setting in which people possess di erent skills and compatibility among potential team members is modeled by a social network. a sequence of tasks arrives in an online fashion, and each task requires a speci c set of skills. the goal is to form a new team upon arrival of each task, so that (i) each team possesses all skills required by the task, (ii) each team has small communication overhead, and (iii) the workload of performing the tasks is balanced among people in the fairest possible way. we propose e cient algorithms that address all these requirements our algorithms form teams that always satisfy the required skills, provide approximation guarantees with respect to team communication overhead, and they are online-competitive with respect to load balancing. experiments performed on collaboration networks among  lm actors and scientists, con rm that our algorithms are successful at balancing these con icting requirements. this is the  rst paper that simultaneously addresses all these aspects. previous work has either focused on minimizing coordination for a single task or balancing the workload neglecting coordination costs.
