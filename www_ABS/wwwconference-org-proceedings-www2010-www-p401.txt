with  the  prosperity  of  tourism  and  web  2.0  technologies,  more and more people have willingness to share their travel experiences on  the  web  (e.g.,  weblogs,  forums,  or  web  2.0  communities). these so-called travelogues contain rich information, particularly including  location-representative  knowledge  such  as  attractions (e.g., golden gate bridge), styles (e.g., beach, history), and activities  (e.g.,  diving,  surfing).  the  location-representative  information  in  travelogues  can  greatly  facilitate  other  tourists   trip  planning,  if  it  can  be  correctly  extracted  and  summarized.  however, since most travelogues are unstructured and contain much noise, it is difficult for common users to utilize such knowledge effectively. in this paper, to mine location-representative knowledge  from a large collection of travelogues, we propose a probabilistic topic model,  named  as  location-topic  model.  this  model  has  the  advantages of (1) differentiability between two kinds of topics, i.e., local topics which characterize locations and global topics which represent  other  common  themes  shared  by  various  locations,  and (2)  representation  of  locations  in  the  local  topic  space  to  encode both  location-representative  knowledge  and  similarities  between locations.  some  novel  applications  are  developed  based  on  the proposed model, including (1) destination recommendation for on flexible queries, (2) characteristic summarization for a given destination  with  representative  tags  and  snippets,  and  (3)  identification of informative parts of a travelogue and enriching such highlights with related images. based on a large collection of travelogues,  the  proposed  framework  is  evaluated  using  both  objective and subjective evaluation methods and shows promising results.
