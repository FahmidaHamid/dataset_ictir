the understanding of semantic web documents is built upon on-tologies that de ne concepts and relationships of data. hence, the correctness of ontologies is vital. ontology reasoners such as racer and fact have been developed to reason ontologies with a high degree of automation. however, complex ontology-related properties may not be expressible within the current web ontology languages, consequently they may not be checkable by racer and fact. we propose to use the software engineering techniques and tools, i.e., z/eves and alloy analyzer, to complement the ontology tools for checking semantic web documents. in this approach, z/eves is  rst applied to remove trivial syntax and type errors of the ontologies. next, racer is used to identify any ontological inconsistencies, whose origins can be traced by alloy analyzer. finally z/eves is used again to express complex ontology-related properties and reveal errors beyond the modeling capabilities of the current web ontology languages. we have successfully applied this approach to checking a set of military plan ontologies.
