master  data  refers  to  core  business  entities  a  company  uses repeatedly across many business processes and systems (such as lists  or  hierarchies  of  customers, suppliers, accounts, products, or  organizational  units).  product  information  is  the  most important  kind  of  master  data  and  product information management (pim) is becoming critical for modern enterprises because  it  provides  a  rich  business  context  for  various applications. existing pim systems are less flexible and scalable for  on-demand  business,  as  well  as  too  weak  to  completely capture  and  use  the  semantics  of  master  data.  this  paper explores  how  to  use  semantic  web  technologies  to  enhance  a collaborative  pim  system  by  simplifying  modeling  and representation  while  preserving  enough  dynamic  flexibility. furthermore, we build a semantic pim system using one of the state-of-art ontology repositories and summarize the challenges we encountered based on our experimental results, especially on performance  and  scalability.  we  believe  that  our  study  and experiences are valuable for both semantic web community and master data management community.
