experienced web users have strategies for information search and re-access  that  are  not  directly  supported  by  web  browsers  or search engines. we studied how prevalent these strategies are and whether even experienced users have problems with searching and re-accessing  information.  with  this  aim,  we  conducted  a  survey with  236  experienced  web  users.  the  results  showed  that  this group  has  frequently  used  key  strategies  (e.g.,  using  several browser  windows  in  parallel)  that  they  find  important,  whereas some of the strategies that have been suggested in previous studies are  clearly  less  important  for  them  (e.g.,  including  urls  on  a webpage). in some aspects, such as query formulation, this group resembles less experienced web users. for instance, we found that most  of  the  respondents  had  misconceptions  about  how  their search  engine  handles  queries,  as  well  as  other  problems  with information  search  and  re-access.  in  addition  to  presenting  the prevalence of the strategies and rationales for their use, we present concrete designs solutions and ideas for making the key strategies also available to less experienced users.
