users searching for information in hypermedia environments often perform querying followed by manual navigation. yet, the conventional text/hypertext retrieval paradigm does not explicity take post-query navigation into account. this paper proposes a new retrieval paradigm, called navigation-aided retrieval (nar), which treats both querying and navigation as  rst-class activities. in the nar paradigm, querying is seen as a means to identify starting points for navigation, and navigation is guided based on information supplied in the query. nar is a generalization of the conventional probabilistic information retrieval paradigm, which implicitly assumes no navigation takes place. this paper presents a formal model for navigation-aided retrieval, and reports empirical results that point to the real-world applicability of the model. the experiments were performed over a large web corpus provided by trec, using human judgments on a new rating scale developed for navigation-aided retrieval. in the case of ambiguous queries, the new retrieval model identi es good starting points for post-query navigation. for less ambiguous queries that need not be paired with navigation, the output closely matches that of a conventional retrieval system.
