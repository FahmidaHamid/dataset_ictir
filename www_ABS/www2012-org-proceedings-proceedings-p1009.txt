web  users  are  increasingly  relying  on  social  interaction  to complete and validate the results of their search activities. while search  systems  are  superior  machines to  get  worldwide information, the opinions collected within friends and expert/local communities  can  ultimately  determine  our  decisions  human curiosity and creativity is often capable of going much beyond the capabilities of search systems in scouting  interesting  results, or suggesting new, unexpected search directions. such personalized interaction occurs in most times aside of the search systems and processes,  possibly  instrumented  and  mediated  by  a  social network;  when such  interaction  is  completed and  users  resort  to the use of search systems, they do it through new queries, loosely related  to  the  previous  search  or  to  the  social  interaction. in this paper we propose crowdsearcher, a novel search paradigm that  embodies  crowds  as  first-class  sources  for  the  information seeking  process.  crowdsearcher  aims  at  filling  the  gap  between generalized  search  systems,  which  operate  upon  worldwide information  -  including  facts  and  recommendations  as  crawled and  indexed  by  computerized  systems     with  social  systems, capable  of  interacting  with  real  people,  in  real  time,  to  capture their opinions, suggestions, emotions. the technical contribution of  this  paper  is  the  discussion  of  a  model  and  architecture  for integrating  computerized  search  with  human  interaction,  by showing  how  search  systems  can  drive  and  encapsulate  social systems.  in  particular  we  show  how  social  platforms,  such  as facebook, linkedin and twitter, can be used for crowdsourcing search-related  tasks;  we  demonstrate  our  approach  with  several prototypes  and  we  report  on  our  experiment  upon  real  user communities.
