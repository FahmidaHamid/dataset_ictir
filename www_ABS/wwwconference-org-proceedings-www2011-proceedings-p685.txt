online video chat services such as chatroulette, omegle, and vchatter that randomly match pairs of users in video chat sessions are fast becoming very popular, with over a million users per month in the case of chatroulette. a key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of  ash-ers and obscene content. this problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minors in such systems. this paper presents safevchat, a novel solution to the problem of  asher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. a key contribution of the paper concerns how the results of the individual detectors are fused together into an overall decision classifying the user as misbehaving or not, based on dempster-shafer theory. the paper introduces a novel, motion-based skin detection method that achieves signi cantly higher recall and better precision. the proposed methods have been evaluated over real-world data and image traces obtained from chatroulette.com.
