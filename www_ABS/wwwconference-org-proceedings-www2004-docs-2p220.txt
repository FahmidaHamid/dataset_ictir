the semantic web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies. therefore, sophisticated semantic web applications typically comprise more than one software module. instead of coming up with proprietary solutions, developers should be able to rely on a generic infrastructure for application development in this context. we call such an infrastructure application server for the semantic web whose design and development are based on existing application servers. however, we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the semantic web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself. we provide a short overview of requirements and design issues of such a server and present our implementation and ongoing work kaon server.
