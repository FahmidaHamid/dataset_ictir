the  performance  of  server-side  applications is  becoming increasingly  important  as  more  applications  exploit  the  web application model. extensive work has been done to improve the performance  of  individual  software  components  such  as  web servers and programming language runtimes. this paper describes a  novel  approach  to  boost  web  application  performance  by improving inter-process communication between a programming language runtime and web server runtime. the approach reduces redundant processing for memory copying and the context switch overhead between user space and kernel space by exploiting the zero-copy data transfer methodology, such as the sendfile system call. in order to transparently utilize this optimization feature with existing web applications, we propose enhancements of the php runtime,  fastcgi  protocol,  and  web  server.  our  proposed approach achieves a 126% performance improvement with micro-benchmarks and a 44% performance improvement for a standard web benchmark, specweb2005.
