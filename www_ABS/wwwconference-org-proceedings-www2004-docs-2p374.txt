we  developed  a  diagrammatic  inference  system  for  the  world wide web. our system enables the creation of diagrams such that the information contained in them can be searched and inference can  be  performed  on  it.  we  developed  an  xmlschema  for  bar, line,  and  pie  charts.  based  on  it,  we  developed  software  that transforms a corresponding xml file into an svg image, which in  turn  is  rendered  by  the  client  as  an  image.  additionally,  we developed  a  search  engine  which  enables  a  user  to  find information explicitly contained in the xml file, and as such in the image. furthermore, we developed an inference engine which enables a user to locate information that is implicitly contained in the image.
