this  paper  presents  a  search  architecture  that  combines  classical search  techniques  with  spread  activation  techniques  applied  to  a semantic  model  of  a  given  domain.  given  an  ontology,  weights are assigned to links based on certain properties of the ontology, so that they measure the strength of the relation. spread activation techniques are used to find related concepts in the ontology given an  initial  set  of  concepts  and  corresponding  initial  activation values.  these  initial  values  are  obtained  from  the  results  of classical search applied to the data associated with the concepts in the ontology. two test cases were implemented, with very positive results.  it  was  also  observed  that  the  proposed  hybrid  spread activation,  combining the  sub-symbolic approaches, achieved better results when compared to each of the approaches alone. the  symbolic  and
