the  new  semantic  web  recommendations  for  rdf,  rdfs  and owl  have,  at  their  heart,  the  rdf  graph.  jena2,  a  second-generation  rdf  toolkit,  is  similarly  centered  on  the rdf graph. rdfs and owl reasoning are seen as graph-to-graph transforms, producing  graphs of virtual triples. rich apis are provided. the model  api  includes  support  for  other  aspects  of  the  rdf recommendations,  such  as  containers  and  reification.  the ontology  api  includes  support  for  rdfs  and  owl,  including advanced owl full support. jena includes the de facto reference rdf/xml parser, and provides rdf/xml output using the full range of the rich rdf/xml grammar. n3 i/o is supported. rdf graphs  can  be  stored  in-memory  or  in  databases.  jena s  query language, rdql, and the web api are both offered for the next round of standardization.
