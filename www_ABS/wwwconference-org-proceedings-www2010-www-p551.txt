we present a programming model for building web applications with security properties that can be con dently veri ed during a security review. in our model, applications are divided into isolated, privilege-separated components, enabling rich security policies to be enforced in a way that can be checked by reviewers. in our model, the web framework enforces privilege separation and isolation of web applications by requiring the use of an object-capability language and providing interfaces that expose limited, explicitly-speci ed privileges to application components. this approach restricts what each component of the application can do and quarantines buggy or compromised code. it also provides a way to more safely integrate third-party, less-trusted code into a web application. we have implemented a prototype of this model based upon the java servlet framework and used it to build a webmail application. our experience with this example suggests that the approach is viable and helpful at establishing reviewable application-speci c security properties.
