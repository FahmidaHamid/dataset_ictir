breaking news often contains timely definitions and descriptions of current terms, organizations and personalities.  we utilize such web  sources  to  construct  definitions  for  such  terms.  previous work  has  identified  definitions  using  handcrafted  rules  or supervised  learning  that  constructs  rigid,  hard  text  patterns.    in contrast, we demonstrate a new approach that uses flexible, soft matching  patterns  to  characterize  definition  sentences.    our  soft patterns  are  able  to  effectively  accommodate  the  diversity  of definition sentence structure exhibited in news.  we use pseudo-relevance feedback to automatically label sentences for use in soft pattern  generation.  the  application  of  our  unsupervised  method significantly improves baseline systems on both the standardized trec corpus as well as crawled online news articles by 27% and 30%,  respectively,  in  terms  of  f  measure.    when  applied  to  a state-of-art  definition  generation  system  recently  fielded  in  the trec 2003 definitional question answering task, it improves the performance by 14%.
