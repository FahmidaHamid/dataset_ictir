we  introduce  an  entity-centric  search  experience,  called  active objects,  in  which  entity-bearing  queries  are  paired  with  actions that can be performed on the entities. for example, given a query for a specific flashlight, we aim to present actions such as reading reviews, watching demo videos, and finding the best price online. in an annotation study conducted over a random sample of user query  sessions,  we  found  that  a  large  proportion  of  queries  in query  logs  involve  actions  on  entities,  calling  for  an  automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries. in this paper, we pose the problem of finding actions that can be performed on entities as the problem of probabilistic inference in a  graphical  model  that  captures  how  an  entity  bearing  query  is generated.  we  design  models  of  increasing  complexity  that capture latent factors such as entity type and intended actions that determine how a user writes a query in a search box, and the url that they click on. given a large collection of real-world queries and  clicks  from  a  commercial  search  engine,  the  models  are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an  em  algorithm.  given  a  new  query,  probabilistic  inference enables  recommendation  of  a  set  of  pertinent  actions  and  hosts. we  propose  an  evaluation  methodology  for  measuring  the relevance  of  our  recommended  actions,  and  show  empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions.
