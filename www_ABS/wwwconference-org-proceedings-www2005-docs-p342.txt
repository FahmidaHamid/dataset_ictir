the  web  has  become  an  excellent  source  for  gathering  consumer opinions.  there  are  now  numerous  web  sites  containing  such opinions,  e.g.,  customer  reviews  of  products,  forums,  discussion groups, and blogs. this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products.  it  makes  two  contributions.  first,  it  proposes  a  novel framework  for  analyzing  and  comparing  consumer  opinions  of competing products. a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented. the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization,  the  user  is  able  to  clearly  see  the  strengths  and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features. this comparison is useful to both potential customers  and  product  manufacturers.  for  a  potential  customer, he/she  can  see  a  visual  side-by-side  and  feature-by-feature comparison  of  consumer  opinions  on  these  products,  which  helps him/her to decide which product to buy. for a product manufacturer, the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information. second, a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews. such features form the basis for the above comparison. experimental results show that  the  technique  is  highly  effective  and  outperform  existing methods significantly.
