we present a framework for approximating random-walk based probability distributions over web pages using graph aggregation. we (1) partition the web s graph into classes of quasi-equivalent vertices, (2) project the page-based random walk to be approximated onto those classes, and (3) compute the stationary probability distribution of the resulting class-based random walk. from this distribution we can quickly reconstruct a distribution on pages. in particular, our framework can approximate the well-known pager-ank distribution by setting the classes according to the set of pages on each web host. we experimented on a web-graph containing over 14 billion pages, and were able to produce a ranking that has spearman rank-order correlation of 0.95 with respect to pagerank. a simplistic implementation of our method required less than half the running time of a highly optimized implementation of pager-ank, implying that larger speedup factors are probably possible.
