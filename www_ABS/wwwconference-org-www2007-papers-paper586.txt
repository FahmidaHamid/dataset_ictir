workers in organizations frequently request help from assistants by  sending  request  messages  that  express  information  intent  an intention  to  update  data  in  an  information  system.  human assistants spend a significant amount of time and effort processing these  requests.  for  example,  human-resource  assistants  process requests  to  update  personnel  records,  and  executive  assistants process requests to schedule conference rooms or to make travel reservations. to process the intent of a request, an assistant reads the request and then locates, completes, and submits a form that corresponds  to  the  expressed  intent.  automatically  or  semi-automatically  processing  the  intent  expressed  in  a  request  on behalf  of  an  assistant  would  ease  the  mundane  and  repetitive nature of this kind of work. for  a  well-understood  domain,  a  straightforward  application  of natural-language-processing  techniques  can  be  used  to  build  an intelligent semi-automatically  process information-intent request messages. however, high performance parsers  are  based  on  machine-learning  algorithms  that  require  a large corpus of examples that have been labeled by an expert. the generation of a labeled corpus of requests is a major barrier to the construction  of  a  parser.  in  this  paper,  we  investigate  the construction  of  a  natural-language-processing  system  and  an intelligent  form  system  that  observes  an  assistant  processing requests.  the  intelligent  form  system  then  generates  a  labeled training  corpus  by  interpreting  the  observations.  this  paper reports  on  the measurement of the performance of the machine-learning  algorithms  based  on  real  data.  the  combination  of observations,  machine  learning,  and  interaction  design  produces an effective intelligent form interface based on natural language processing. interface form to
