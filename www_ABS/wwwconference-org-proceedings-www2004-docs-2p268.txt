service matchmaking and composition has recently drawn increasing attention in the research community. most existing algorithms construct chains of services based on exact matches of input/output types. however, this does not work when the available services only cover a part of the range of the input type. we present an algorithm that also allows partial matches and composes them using switches that decide on the required service at runtime based on the actual data type. we report experiments on randomly generated composition problems that show that using partial matches can decrease the failure rate of the integration algorithm using only complete matches by up to 7 times with no increase in the number of directory accesses required. this shows that composition with partial matches is an essential and useful element of web service composition.1
