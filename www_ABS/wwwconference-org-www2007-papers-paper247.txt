personalized  web  search  is  a  promising  way  to  improve  search quality  by  customizing  search  results  for  people  with  individual information  goals.  however,  users  are  uncomfortable  with exposing private preference information to search engines. on the other hand, privacy is not absolute, and often can be compromised if  there  is  a  gain  in  service  or  profitability  to  the  user.  thus,  a balance  must  be  struck  between  search  quality  and  privacy protection.  this  paper  presents  a  scalable  way  for  users  to automatically build rich user profiles. these profiles summarize a user s  interests  into  a  hierarchical  organization  according  to specific interests.  two  parameters  for  specifying  privacy requirements are proposed to help the user to choose the content and degree of detail of the profile information that is exposed to the  search  engine.  experiments  showed  that  the  user  profile improved  search  quality  when  compared  to  standard  msn rankings. more importantly, results verified our hypothesis that a significant  improvement  on  search  quality  can  be  achieved  by only sharing some higher-level user profile information, which is potentially less sensitive than detailed personal information.
