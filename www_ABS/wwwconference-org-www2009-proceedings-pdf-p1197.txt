both  search  engine  click-through  log  and  social  annotation  have been  utilized  as  user  feedback  for  search  result  re-ranking. however, to our best knowledge, no previous study has explored the  correlation  between  these  two  factors  for  the  task  of  search result  re-ranking.  in  this  paper,  we  show  that  the  gap  between search  queries  and  social  tags  of  the  same  web  page  can  well reflect its user preference score. motivated by this observation, we propose  a  novel  algorithm,  called  query-tag-gap  (qtg),  to  re-rank search results for better user satisfaction. intuitively, on one hand, the search users  intentions are generally described by their queries before they read the search results. on the other hand, the web  annotators  semantically  tag  web  pages  after  they  read  the content of the pages. the difference between users  recognition of the same page before and after they read it is a good reflection of user satisfaction. in this extended abstract, we formally define the query  set  and  tag  set  of  the  same  page  as  users   pre-  and  post-knowledge  respectively.  we  empirically  show the  strong correlation  between  user  satisfaction  and  user s  knowledge  gap before and after reading the page. based on this gap, experiments have  shown  outstanding  performance  of  our  proposed  qtg algorithm in search result re-ranking.
