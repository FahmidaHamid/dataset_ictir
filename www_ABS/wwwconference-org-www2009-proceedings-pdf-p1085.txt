we  consider template-independent  news extraction. the state-of-the-art news extraction method is based on  template-level  wrapper  induction,  which  has  two  serious limitations. 1) it cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen  template  until  the  wrapper  for  that  template  has  been generated.  2)  it  is  costly  to  maintain  up-to-date  wrappers  for hundreds  of  websites,  because  any  change  of  a  template  may lead  to  the  invalidation  of  the  corresponding  wrapper.  in  this paper  we  formalize  news  extraction  as  a  machine  learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small  number  of  labeled  news  pages  from  a  single  site.  novel features  dedicated  to  news  titles  and  bodies  are  developed respectively.  correlations  between  the  news  title  and  the  news body  are  exploited.  our  template-independent  wrapper  can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates. in  experiments,  a  wrapper  is  learned  from  40  pages  from  a single  news  site.  it  achieved  98.1%  accuracy  over  3,973  news pages from 12 news sites.
