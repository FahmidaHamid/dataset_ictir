this  paper  proposes  an  effective  approach  to  provide  relevant search  terms  for  conceptual  web  search.   semantic  term suggestion  function has been included so that users can find the most  appropriate  query they  really  need. conventional  approaches  for  term  suggestion  involve  extracting frequently  occurring  key  terms  from  retrieved  documents.  they must deal with term extraction difficulties and interference from irrelevant documents. in this paper, we propose a semantic term suggestion  function  called  collective  intelligence  based  term suggestion (cits). cits provides a novel social-network based framework for relevant terms suggestion with a semantic graph of the  search  term  without  limiting  to  the  specific  query  term.  a visualization  of semantic  graph is  presented  to the  users  to  help browsing search results from related terms in the semantic graph. the  search  results  are  ranked  each  time  according  to  their relevance  to  the  related  terms  in  the  entire  query  session. comparing  to  two  popular  commercial  search  engines,  a  user study  of  18  users  on  50  search  terms  showed  better  user satisfactions  and  indicated  the  potential  usefulness  of  proposed method in real-world search applications.
