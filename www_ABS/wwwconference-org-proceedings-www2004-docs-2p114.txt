learning  styles,  as  well  as  the  best  ways  of  responding  with corresponding  instructional  strategies,  have  been  intensively studied  in  the  classical  educational  (classroom)  setting.  there  is much  less  research  of  application  of  learning  styles  in  the  new educational  space,  created  by  the  web.  moreover,  authoring applications are scarce, and they do not provide explicit choices and creation of instructional strategies for specific learning styles. the  main  objective  of  the  research  described  in  this  paper  is  to provide  the  authors  with  a  tool  which  will  allow  them  to incorporate different learning styles in their adaptive educational hypermedia  applications.  in this  way,  we  are  creating  a semantically significant interface between classical learning styles and  instructional  strategies  and  the  modern  field  of  adaptive educational hypermedia.
