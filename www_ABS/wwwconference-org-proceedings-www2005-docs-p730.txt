design of high performance web servers has become a recent research thrust to meet the increasing demand of network-based services. in this paper, we propose a new web server architecture, called multi-threaded pipelined web server, suitable for symmetric multiprocessor (smp) or system-on-chip (soc) architectures. the proposed pipelined model consists of multiple thread pools, where each thread pool consists of  ve basic threads and two helper threads. the main advantages of the proposed model are global information sharing by the threads, minimal synchronization overhead due to less number of threads, and non-blocking i/o operations, possible with the helper threads. we have conducted an in-depth performance analysis of the proposed server model along with four prior web server models (multi-process (mp), multi-thread (mt), single-process event-driven (sped) and asynchronous multi-pro-cess event-driven (amped)) via simulation using six web server workloads. the experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of various factors such as the memory size, disk speed and numbers of clients. the simulation results indicate that the proposed pipelined web server architecture shows the best performance across all system and workload parameters compared to the mp, mt, sped and amped models. although the mt and amped models show competitive performance with less number of processors, the advantage of the pipelined model becomes obvious as the number of processors or clients in an smp/soc machine increases. the mp model shows the worst performance in most of the cases. the results indicate that the proposed server architecture can be used in future large-scale smp/soc machines to boost system performance.
