the  difficulty  of  developing  and  deploying  commercial  web applications  increases  as  the  number  of  technologies  they  use increases  and  as  the  interactions  between  these  technologies become more complex.  this paper describes a way to avoid this increasing complexity by reexamining the basic requirements of web applications.  our approach is to first separate client concerns from server concerns, and then to reduce the interaction between client  and  server  to  its  most  elemental  parameter  passing.    we define  a  simplified  programming  model  for  form-based  web applications and we use xforms and a subset of j2ee as enabling technologies.  we describe our implementation of an mvc-based application builder for this model, which automatically generates the code needed to marshal input and output data between clients and servers.  this marshalling uses type checking and other forms of validation on both clients and servers.  we also show how our programming  model  and  application  builder  support the customization of web applications for different execution targets, including, for example, different client devices.
