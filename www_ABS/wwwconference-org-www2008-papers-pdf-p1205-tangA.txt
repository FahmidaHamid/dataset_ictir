name ambiguity problem has been a challenging issue for a long history. in this paper, we intend to make a thorough investigation of  the  whole  problem.  specifically,  we  formalize  the  name disambiguation problem in a unified framework. the framework can incorporate both attribute and relationship into a probabilistic model.  we  explore  a  dynamic  approach  for  automatically estimating the person number k and employ an adaptive distance measure  to  estimate  the  distance  between  objects.  experimental results  show  that  our  proposed  framework  can  significantly outperform the baseline method.
