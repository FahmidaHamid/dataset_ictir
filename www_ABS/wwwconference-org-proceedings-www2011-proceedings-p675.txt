we analyze the information credibility of news propagated through twitter, a popular microblogging service. previous research has shown that most of the messages posted on twitter are truthful, but the service is also used to spread misinformation and false rumors, often unintentionally. on this paper we focus on automatic methods for assessing the credibility of a given set of tweets. speci cally, we analyze microblog postings related to  trending  topics, and classify them as credible or not credible, based on features extracted from them. we use features from users  posting and re-posting ( re-tweeting ) behavior, from the text of the posts, and from citations to external sources. we evaluate our methods using a signi cant number of human assessments about the credibility of items on a recent sample of twitter postings. our results shows that there are measurable di erences in the way messages propagate, that can be used to classify them automatically as credible or not credible, with precision and recall in the range of 70% to 80%.
