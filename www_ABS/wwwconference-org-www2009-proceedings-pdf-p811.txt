geographical  context  is  very  important  for  images.  millions  of images  on  the  web  have  been  already  assigned  latitude  and longitude  information.  due  to  the  rapid  proliferation  of  such images with geographical context, it is still difficult to effectively search  and  browse  them,  since  we  do  not  have  ways  to  decide their  relevance.  in  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  geographical relevance of images,  which is defined as to what extent the main objects  in  an  image  match  landmarks  at  the  location  where  the image  was  taken.  recently,  researchers  have  proposed  to  use game  based  approaches  to  label  large  scale  data  such  as  web images.  however,  previous  works  have  not  shown  the  quality  of collected  game  logs  in  detail  and  how  the  logs  can  improve existing  applications.  to  answer  these  questions,  we  design  and implement  a  web-based  and  multiplayer  game  to  collect  human knowledge  while  people  are  enjoying  the  game.  then  we thoroughly  analyze  the  game  logs  obtained  during  a  three  week study with 147 participants and propose methods to determine the image  geographical  relevance.  in  addition,  we  conduct  an experiment  to  compare  our  methods  with  a  commercial  search engine.  experimental  results  show  that  our  methods  dramatically improve  image  search  relevance.  furthermore,  we  show  that  we can derive geographically relevant objects and their salient portion in images, which is valuable for a number of applications such as image location recognition.
