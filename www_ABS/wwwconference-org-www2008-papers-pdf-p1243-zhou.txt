we consider the budget-constrained bidding optimization problem for sponsored search auctions, and model it as an online (multiple-choice) knapsack problem. we design both deterministic and randomized algorithms for the online (multiple-choice) knapsack problems achieving a provably optimal competitive ratio. this translates back to fully automatic bidding strategies maximizing either pro t or revenue for the budget-constrained advertiser. our bidding strategy for revenue maximization is oblivious (i.e., without knowledge) of other bidders  prices and/or click-through-rates for those positions. we evaluate our bidding algorithms using both synthetic data and real bidding data gathered manually, and also discuss a sniping heuristic that strictly improves bidding performance. with sniping and parameter tuning enabled, our bidding algorithms can achieve a performance ratio above 90% against the optimum by the omniscient bidder.
