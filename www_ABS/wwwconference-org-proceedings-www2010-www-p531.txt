semantic web data exhibits very skewed frequency distributions among terms. e cient large-scale distributed reasoning methods should maintain load-balance in the face of such highly skewed distribution of input data. we show that term-based partitioning, used by most distributed reasoning approaches, has limited scalability due to load-balancing problems. we address this problem with a method for data distribution based on clustering in elastic regions. instead of assigning data to  xed peers, data  ows semi-randomly in the network. data items  speed-date  while being temporarily collocated in the same peer. we introduce a bias in the routing to allow semantically clustered neighborhoods to emerge. our approach is self-organising, e cient and does not require any central coordination. we have implemented this method on the marvin platform and have performed experiments on large real-world datasets, using a cluster of up to 64 nodes. we compute the rdfs closure over di erent datasets and show that our clustering algorithm drastically reduces computation time, calculating the rdfs closure of 200 million triples in 7.2 minutes.
