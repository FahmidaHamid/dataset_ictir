this paper presents the groupme! system, a resource sharing system with advanced tagging functionality. groupme! provides a novel user interface, which enables users to organize and arrange arbitrary web resources into groups. the content of such groups can be overlooked and inspected immediately as resources are visualized in a multimedia-based fashion. in this paper, we furthermore introduce new folksonomy-based ranking strategies that exploit the group structure shipped with groupme! folksonomies. experiments show that those strategies signi cantly improve the performance of such ranking algorithms.
