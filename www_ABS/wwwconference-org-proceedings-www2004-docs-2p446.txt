courseware systems are often based on an assembly of different components,  addressing  the  different  needs  of  storage  and delivery functionality.  the  learning  technology  standard architecture ltsa provides a generic architectural framework for these systems. recent developments in web technology   e.g. the web services framework   have greatly enhanced the flexible and interoperable implementation of courseware architectures. we  argue  that  in  order  to  make  the  web  services  philosophy work,  two  enhancements  to  the  ltsa  approach  are  required. firstly,  a  combination  with  metadata  annotation  is  needed  to support  the  discovery  of  educational  web  services.  secondly,  if these  components  are  to  be  provided  in  form  of  services,  more support  is  needed  for  their  assembly.  architectural  patterns  of  a finer degree of granularity shall satisfy this need.
