the primary function of current web search engines is essentially relevance  ranking  at  the  document  level.  however,  myriad structured  information  about  real-world  objects  is  embedded  in static  web  pages  and  online  web  databases.  document-level information  retrieval  can  unfortunately  lead  to  highly  inaccurate relevance  ranking  in  answering  object-oriented  queries.  in  this paper,  we  propose  a  paradigm  shift  to  enable  searching  at  the object retrieval  models, documents  are  taken  as  the  retrieval  units  and  the  content  of  a document this  reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context when multiple  copies  of  information  about  the  same  object  typically exist.  these  copies  may  be  inconsistent  because  of  diversity  of web  site  qualities  and  the  limited  performance  of  current information extraction techniques. if we simply combine the noisy and  inaccurate  attribute  information  extracted  from  different sources,  we  may  not  be  able  to  achieve  satisfactory  retrieval performance.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  several  language  models for  web  object  retrieval,  namely  an  unstructured  object  retrieval model,  a  structured  object  retrieval  model,  and  a  hybrid  model with  both  structured  and  unstructured  retrieval  features.  we  test these  models  on  a  paper  search  engine  and  compare  their performances.  we  conclude  that  the  hybrid  model  is  the  superior by taking into account the extraction errors at varying levels.
