server-side programming is one of the key technologies that support today s www environment. it makes it possible to generate web pages dynamically according to a user s request and to customize pages for each user. however, the  exibility obtained by server-side programming makes it much harder to guarantee validity and security of dynamically generated pages. to check statically the properties of web pages generated dynamically by a server-side program, we develop a static program analysis that approximates the string output of a program with a context-free grammar. the approximation obtained by the analyzer can be used to check various properties of a server-side program and the pages it generates. to demonstrate the e ectiveness of the analysis, we have implemented a string analyzer for the server-side scripting language php. the analyzer is successfully applied to publicly available php programs to detect cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and to validate pages they generate dynamically.
