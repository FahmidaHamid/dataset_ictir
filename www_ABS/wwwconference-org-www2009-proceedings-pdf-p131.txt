web 2.0 technologies have enabled more and more people to freely comment on di erent kinds of entities (e.g. sellers, products, services). the large scale of information poses the need and challenge of automatic summarization. in many cases, each of the user-generated short comments comes with an overall rating. in this paper, we study the problem of generating a  rated aspect summary  of short comments, which is a decomposed view of the overall ratings for the major aspects so that a user could gain di erent perspectives towards the target entity. we formally de ne the problem and decompose the solution into three steps. we demonstrate the e ectiveness of our methods by using ebay sellers  feedback comments. we also quantitatively evaluate each step of our methods and study how well human agree on such a summa-rization task. the proposed methods are quite general and can be used to generate rated aspect summary automatically given any collection of short comments each associated with an overall rating.
