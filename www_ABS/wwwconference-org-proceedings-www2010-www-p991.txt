today  the  major  web  search  engines  answer  queries  by  showing ten result snippets, which need to be inspected by users for identifying relevant results. in this paper we investigate how to extract structured  information  from  the  web,  in  order  to  directly  answer queries  by  showing  the  contents being  searched  for.  we  treat  users  search trails (i.e., post-search browsing behaviors) as implicit labels  on  the  relevance  between  web  contents  and  user  queries. based  on  such  labels  we  use  information  extraction  approach  to build  wrappers  and  extract  structured  information.  an  important observation is that many web sites contain pages for name entities of  certain  categories  (e.g.,  aol  music  contains  a  page  for  each musician),  and  these  pages  have  the  same  format.  this  makes  it possible to build wrappers from a small amount of implicit labels, and  use  them  to  extract  structured  information  from  many  web pages  for different name entities. we propose struclick, a  fully automated system for extracting structured information for queries containing  name  entities of  certain  categories.  it can identify  important  web  sites  from  web  search  logs,  build  wrappers  from  users   search  trails,  filter  out  bad  wrappers  built  from  random  user clicks,  and  combine  structured  information  from  different  web sites  for  each  query.  comparing  with  existing  approaches  on  information extraction, struclick can assign semantics to extracted data  without  any  human  labeling  or  supervision.  we  perform comprehensive  experiments,  which  show  struclick  achieves high accuracy and good scalability.
