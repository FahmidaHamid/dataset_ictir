automatic folksonomy construction from tags has attracted much attention recently. however, inferring hierarchical relations between concepts from tags has a drawback in that it is di cult to distinguish between more popular and more general concepts. instead of tags we propose to use user-speci ed relations for learning folksonomy. we explore two statistical frameworks for aggregating many shallow individual hierarchies, expressed through the collection/set relations on the social photosharing site flickr, into a common deeper folksonomy that re ects how a community organizes knowledge. our approach addresses a number of challenges that arise while aggregating information from diverse users, namely noisy vocabulary, and variations in the granularity level of the concepts expressed. our second contribution is a method for automatically evaluating learned folksonomy by comparing it to a reference taxonomy, e.g., the web directory created by the open directory project. our empirical results suggest that user-speci ed relations are a good source of evidence for learning folksonomies.
