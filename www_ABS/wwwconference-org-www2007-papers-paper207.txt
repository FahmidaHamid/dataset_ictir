given a large online network of online auction users and their histories of transactions, how can we spot anomalies and auction fraud? this paper describes the design and implementation of netprobe, a system that we propose for solving this problem. netprobe models auction users and transactions as a markov random field tuned to detect the suspicious patterns that fraudsters create, and employs a belief propagation mechanism to detect likely fraudsters. our experiments show that netprobe is both e cient and e ective for fraud detection. we report experiments on synthetic graphs with as many as 7,000 nodes and 30,000 edges, where netprobe was able to spot fraudulent nodes with over 90% precision and recall, within a matter of seconds. we also report experiments on a real dataset crawled from ebay, with nearly 700,000 transactions between more than 66,000 users, where netprobe was highly e ective at unearthing hidden networks of fraudsters, within a realistic response time of about 6 minutes. for scenarios where the underlying data is dynamic in nature, we propose incremental netprobe, which is an approximate, but fast, variant of net-probe. our experiments prove that incremental netprobe executes nearly doubly fast as compared to netprobe, while retaining over 99% of its accuracy.
