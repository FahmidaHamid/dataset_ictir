peer  services  depend  on  one  another  to  accomplish  their  tasks, and  their  structures  may  evolve.  a  service  composition  may  be designed to replace its member services whenever the quality of the  composite  service  fails  to  meet  certain  quality-of-service (qos) requirements. finding services and service invocation endpoints having the greatest impact on the quality are important to guide subsequent service adaptations. this paper proposes a technique that samples the qos of composite services and continually analyzes  them  to  identify  artifacts  for  service  adaptation.  the preliminary  results  show  that  our  technique  has  the  potential  to effectively find such artifacts in services.
