security remains a major roadblock to universal acceptance of the web  for  many  kinds  of  transactions,  especially  since  the  recent sharp  increase  in  remotely  exploitable  vulnerabilities  has  been attributed  to  web  application  bugs.  many  verification  tools  are discovering  previously  unknown  vulnerabilities  in  legacy  c programs,  raising  hopes  that  the  same  success  can  be  achieved with  web  applications.  in  this  paper,  we  describe  a  sound  and holistic approach to ensuring web application security. viewing web  application  vulnerabilities  as  a  secure  information  flow problem,  we  created  a  lattice-based  static  analysis  algorithm derived  from  type  systems  and  typestate,  and  addressed  its soundness.  during  the  analysis,  sections  of  code  considered vulnerable  are  instrumented  with  runtime  guards,  thus  securing web  applications  in  the  absence  of  user  intervention.  with sufficient annotations, runtime overhead can be reduced to zero. we  also  created  a  tool  named  webssari  (web  application security by static analysis and runtime inspection)  to test our algorithm, and used it to verify 230 open-source web application projects  on  sourceforge.net,  which  were  selected  to  represent projects of different maturity, popularity, and scale. 69 contained vulnerabilities  and  their  developers  were  notified.  38  projects acknowledged  our  findings  and  stated  their  plans  to  provide patches.  our  statistics  also  show  that  static  analysis  reduced potential runtime overhead by 98.4%.
