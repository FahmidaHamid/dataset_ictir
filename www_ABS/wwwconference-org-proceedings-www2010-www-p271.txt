in an ideal world, interface design is the art and science of helping users  accomplish  tasks  in  a  timely,  efficient,  and  pleasurable manner.  this  paper  studies  the  inverse  situation,  the  vast emergence  of  deliberately  constructed  malicious  interfaces  that violate design best practices in order to accomplish goals counter to those of the user.  this has become a commonplace occurrence both on and off the desktop, particularly on the web.  a primary objective  of  this  paper  is  to  formally  define  this  problem, including  construction  of  a  taxonomy  of  malicious  interface techniques  and  a  preliminary  analysis  of  their  impact  on  users. findings are presented that gauge the self-reported tolerance and expectation levels of users with regard to malicious interfaces as well  as the  effectiveness  and  ease  of  use  of  existing countermeasures. a second objective of this paper is to increase awareness,  dialogue,  and  research  in  a  domain  that  we  consider largely  unexplored  but  critical  to  future  usability  of  the  www. our results were accomplished through significant compilation of malicious  interface  techniques  based  on  review  of  thousands  of web sites and by conducting three surveys.  ultimately, this paper concludes that malicious interfaces are a ubiquitous problem that demands  intervention  by  the  security  and  human  computer interaction communities in order to reduce the negative impact on the global user population.
