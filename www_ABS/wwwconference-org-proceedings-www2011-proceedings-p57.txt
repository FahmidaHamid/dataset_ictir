with the explosive growth of online news readership, recommending interesting news articles to users has become extremely important. while existing web services such as yahoo! and digg attract users  initial clicks by leveraging various kinds of signals, how to engage such users algorith-mically after their initial visit is largely under explored. in this paper, we study the problem of post-click news recommendation. given that a user has perused a current news article, our idea is to automatically identify  related  news articles which the user would like to read afterwards. specifically, we propose to characterize relatedness between news articles across four aspects relevance, novelty, connection clarity, and transition smoothness. motivated by this understanding, we de ne a set of features to capture each of these aspects and put forward a learning approach to model relatedness. in order to quantitatively evaluate our proposed measures and learn a uni ed relatedness function, we construct a large test collection based on a four-month commercial news corpus with editorial judgments. the experimental results show that the proposed heuristics can indeed capture relatedness, and that the learned uni ed relatedness function works quite e ectively.
