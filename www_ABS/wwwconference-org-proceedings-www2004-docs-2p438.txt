as  web  service  technology  matures  there  is  growing  interest  in exploiting  workflow  techniques  to  coordinate  web  services. bioinformaticians  are  a  user  community  who  combine  web resources  to  perform  in  silico  experiments.    these  users  are scientists  and  not  information  technology  experts;  they  require workflow solutions that have a low cost of entry for service users and  providers.  problems  satisfying  these  requirements  with current  techniques  led  to  the  development  of  the  simple conceptual  unified  flow  language  (scufl).  scufl  is  supported  by the  freefluo  enactment  engine  [1],  and  the  taverna  editing workbench  [3].  the  extensibility  of  scufl,  supported  by  these tools,  means  that  workflows  coordinating  web  services  can  be matched  to  how  users  view  their  problems.  the  taverna workbench  exploits  the  web  to  keep  scufl  simple  by  retrieving detail from uris when required, and by scavenging the web for services. scufl and its tools are not bioinformatics specific. they can  be  exploited  by  other  communities  who  require  user-driven composition  and  execution  of  workflows  coordinating  web resources. categories & subject descriptors d.2.6 [programming environments] integrated environments, programmer workbench
