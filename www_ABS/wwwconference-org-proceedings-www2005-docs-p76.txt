this  paper  studies  the  problem  of  extracting  data  from  a  web page that contains several structured data records. the objective is to segment these data records, extract data items/fields from them and  put  the  data  in  a  database  table.  this  problem  has  been studied  by  several  researchers.  however,  existing  methods  still have some serious limitations. the first class of methods is based on  machine  learning,  which  requires  human  labeling  of  many examples from each web site that one is interested in extracting data from. the process is time consuming due to the large number of sites and pages on the web. the second class of algorithms is based  on  automatic  pattern  discovery.  these  methods  are  either inaccurate or make many assumptions. this paper proposes a new method to perform the task automatically. it consists of two steps, (1) identifying individual data records in a page, and (2) aligning and  extracting  data  items  from  the  identified  data  records.  for step  1,  we  propose  a  method  based  on  visual  information  to segment  data  records,  which  is  more  accurate  than  existing methods.  for  step  2,  we  propose  a  novel  partial  alignment technique  based  on  tree  matching.  partial  alignment  means  that we align only those data fields in a pair of data records that can be aligned (or matched) with certainty, and make no commitment on the  rest  of  the  data  fields.  this  approach  enables  very  accurate alignment of multiple data records. experimental results using a large number of web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is able to segment data records, align and extract data from them very accurately.
