in  this  paper,  a  benchmark  called  wpbench  is  reported  to evaluate the responsiveness of web browsers for modern web 2.0 applications. in wpbench, variations of servers and networks are removed  and  the  benchmark  result  is  the  closest  to  what  web users would perceive. to achieve these, wpbench records users  interactions  with  typical  web  2.0  applications,  and  then  replays web  navigations  when  benchmarking  browsers.  the  replay mechanism  can  emulate  the  actual  user  interactions  and  the characteristics of the servers and the networks in a consistent way independent  of  browsers  so  that  any  browser  compliant  to  the standards can be benchmarked fairly. in addition to describing the design and generation of wpbench, we also report the wpbench comparison  results  on  the  responsiveness  performance  for  three popular web browsers internet explorer, firefox and chrome.
