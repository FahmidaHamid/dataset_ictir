most  of  the  approaches  for  dealing  with  uncertainty  in  the semantic web rely on the principle that this uncertainty is already asserted. in this paper, we propose a new  approach to learn and reason  about  uncertainty  in  the  semantic  web.  using  instance data, we learn the uncertainty of an owl ontology, and use that information  to  perform  probabilistic  reasoning  on  it.  for  this purpose,  we  use  markov  logic,  a  new  representation  formalism that combines logic with probabilistic graphical models.
