the  web  is  rapidly  moving  towards  a  platform  for  mass collaboration  in  content  production  and  consumption.  fresh content on a variety of topics, people, and places is being created and made available on the web at breathtaking speed. navigating the  content  effectively  not  only  requires  techniques  such  as aggregating various rss-enabled feeds, but it also demands a new browsing paradigm. in this paper, we present novel geospatial and temporal  browsing  techniques  that  provide  users  with  the capability of aggregating and navigating rss-enabled content in a timely,  personalized  and  automatic  manner.  in  particular,  we describe  a  system  called  geotracker  that  utilizes  both  a geospatial (chronological) presentation to help users spot the most relevant updates quickly. within the context of this work, we provide a middleware engine that  supports  intelligent  aggregation  and  dissemination  of  rss feeds  with  personalization  to  desktops  and  mobile  devices.  we study  the  navigation  capabilities  of  this  system  on  two  kinds  of data sets, namely, 2006 world cup soccer data collected over two months  and  breaking  news  items  that  occur  every  day.  we  also demonstrate that the application of such technologies to the video search results returned by youtube and google greatly enhances a  user s  ability in locating and browsing videos based on his or her  geographical  interests.  finally,  we  demonstrate  that  the location  inference  performance  of  geotracker  compares  well against machine learning techniques used in the natural language processing/information its algorithm simplicity, it preserves high recall percentages.
