as implementing  b2b applications,  the  need  arises  of  web  conceptual  models  for describing  web  oriented  workflow  applications  implementing business  processes.  in  this  context,  new  problems  about  process correctness  arise,  due  to  the  loose  control  of  web  applications upon the behavior of their web clients. indeed, incoherent user s behavior can lead to inconsistent processes. this  paper  presents  a  high  level  approach to the management of exceptions  that  occur  during  the  execution  of  processes  on  the web. we present a classification of exceptions that can be raised inside  workflow-driven  web  applications,  and  recovery  policies to retrieve coherent status and data after an exception. we devise these concepts at high level and then we exploit them using a web modeling  language  (webml)  that  in  turn  provides  development facilities  like  automatic  code  generation,  validation  of  hypertext models,  and  so  on.  an  industrial  implementation  experience  is briefly presented too.
