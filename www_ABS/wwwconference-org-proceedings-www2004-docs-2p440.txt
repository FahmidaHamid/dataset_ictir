in the problem of learning with positive and unlabeled examples, existing  research  all  assumes  that  positive  examples  p  and  the hidden  positive  examples  in  the  unlabeled  set  u  are  generated from  the  same  distribution.  this  assumption  may  be  violated  in practice.  in  such  cases,  existing  methods  perform  poorly.  this paper proposes a novel technique a-em to deal with the problem. experimental results with product page classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. categories & subject descriptors h.2.8 [database applications] data mining
