in  this  paper,  we  present  our  development  of  a  document management  and  retrieval  tool,  which  is  named  ontalk.  our system  provides  a  semiautomatic  metadata  generator  and  an ontology-based  search  engine  for  electronic  documents.  ontalk can  create  or  import  various  ontologies  in  rdfs  or  owl  for describing  the  metadata.  our  system  that  is  built  upon  .net technology is easily communicated with  or  flexibly  plugged  into many different programs.
