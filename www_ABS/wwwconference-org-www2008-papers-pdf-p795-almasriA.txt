searching for web service access points is no longer attached to service  registries  as  web  search  engines  have  become  a  new major  source  for  discovering  web  services.  in  this  work,  we conduct  a  thorough  analytical  investigation  on  the  plurality  of web  service  interfaces  that  exist  on  the  web  today.  using  our web  service  crawler  engine  (wsce),  we  collect  metadata service  information  on  retrieved  interfaces  through  accessible ubrs,  service  portals  and  search  engines.  we  use  this  data  to determine web service statistics and distribution based on object sizes,  types  of  technologies  employed,  and  the  number  of functioning  services.  this  statistical  data  can  be  used  to  help determine  the  current  status  of  web  services.  we  determine  an intriguing  result  that  63%  of  the  available  web  services  on  the web are considered to be active. we further use our findings to provide insights on improving the service retrieval process.
