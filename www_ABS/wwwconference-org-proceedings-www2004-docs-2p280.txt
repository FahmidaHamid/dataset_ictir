on-demand broadcast has been supported in the internet to enhance system scalability. unfortunately, most of existing on-demand scheduling algorithms did not consider the time constraints associated with web requests. this paper proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, called slack inverse number of requests (sin), that takes into account the urgency and productivity of serving pending requests. trace-driven experiments demonstrate that sin signi cantly outperforms existing algorithms over a wide range of workloads.
