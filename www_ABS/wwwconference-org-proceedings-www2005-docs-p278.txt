the increased importance of xml as a data representation format has led to several proposals for facilitating the development of applications that operate on xml data. these proposals range from runtime api-based interfaces to xml-based programming languages. the subject of this paper is xj, a research language that proposes novel mechanisms for the integration of xml as a  rst-class construct into javatm. the design goals of xj distinguish it from past work on integrating xml support into programming languages   speci cally, the xj design adheres to the xml schema and xpath standards. moreover, it supports in-place updates of xml data thereby keeping with the imperative nature of java. we have built a prototype compiler for xj, and our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the performance of xj programs can approach that of traditional low-level api-based interfaces, while providing a higher level of abstraction.
