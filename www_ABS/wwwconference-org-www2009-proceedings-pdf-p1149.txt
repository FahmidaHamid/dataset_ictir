people use weblogs to express thoughts, present ideas and share knowledge, therefore weblogs are extraordinarily valuable resources, amongs others, for trend analysis. trends are derived from the chronological sequence of blog post count per topic. the comparison with a reference corpus allows qualitative statements over identi ed trends. we propose a crosslanguage blog mining and trend visualisation system to analyse blogs across languages and topics. the trend visu-alisation facilitates the identi cation of trends and the comparison with the reference news article corpus. to prove the correctness of our system we computed the correlation between trends in blogs and news articles for a subset of blogs and topics. the evaluation corroborated our hypothesis of a high correlation coe cient for these subsets and therefore the correctness of our system for di erent languages and topics is proven.
