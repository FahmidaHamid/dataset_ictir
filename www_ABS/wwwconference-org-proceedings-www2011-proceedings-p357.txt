this  paper  uses  the  url  word  breaking  task  as  an  example  to elaborate what we identify as crucialin designingstatistical natural language processing (nlp) algorithmsfor web scale applications (1) rudimentary multilingual capabilities to cope with the global nature  of  the  web,  (2)  multi-style  modeling  to  handle  diverse language  styles  seen  in  the  web  contents,  (3)  fast  adaptation  to keep  pace  with  the  dynamic  changes  of  the  web,  (4)  minimal heuristic assumptions for generalizability and robustness, and (5) possibilities  of  efficient  implementations  and  minimal  manual efforts for processing massive amount of data at a reasonable cost. we first show that the state-of-the-art word breaking techniques-can be unified and generalized under the bayesian minimum risk (bmr) framework that, using a web scale n-gram, can meet the first three requirements. we discuss how the existing techniques can be viewed asintroducing additional assumptions to the basic bmr framework, and describe a generic yet efficient implementation called word synchronous beam search.testing the framework and its implementation on a series of large scale experiments reveals  the  following.  first,  the  language  style  used  to  build  the modelplays a critical role in the word breaking task, and the most suitable for the url word breaking task appears to be that ofthe document  title  where  the  best  performance  is  obtained.  models created from other language styles, such as from document body, anchor  text,  and  even  queries,  exhibit  varying  degrees  of  mismatch. although all styles benefit from increasing modeling power  which,  in  our  experiments,  corresponds  tothe  use  of  a  higher order  n-gram,  the  gain  is  most  recognizable  for  the title  model. the heuristics proposed by the prior arts do contribute to the word breaking  performance  for  mismatched  or  less  powerful  models, but  are  less  effective  and,  in  many  cases,lead  to  poorer  performance than the matched model with minimal assumptions. for the matched  model  based  on  document  titles,  an  accuracy  rate  of 97.18% can already be achieved using simple trigram without any heuristics.
