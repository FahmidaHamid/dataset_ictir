we address the problem of clustering the re nements of a user search query. the clusters computed by our proposed algorithm can be used to improve the selection and placement of the query suggestions proposed by a search engine, and can also serve to summarize the di erent aspects of information relevant to the original user query. our algorithm clusters re nements based on their likely underlying user intents by combining document click and session co-occurrence information. at its core, our algorithm operates by performing multiple random walks on a markov graph that approximates user search behavior. a user study performed on top search engine queries shows that our clusters are rated better than corresponding clusters computed using approaches that use only document click or only sessions co-occurrence information.
