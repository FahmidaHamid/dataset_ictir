this paper presents the design and user evaluation of smartback, a feature that complements the standard back button by enabling users  to  jump  directly  to  key  pages  in  their  navigation  session, making common navigation activities more efficient. defining key pages was informed by the findings of a user study that involved detailed monitoring of web usage and analysis of web browsing in  terms  of  navigation  trails.  the  pages  accessible  through smartback are determined automatically based on the structure of the user s navigation trails or page association with specific user s activities,  such  as  search  or  browsing  bookmarked  sites.  we discuss implementation decisions and present results of a usability study  in  which  we  deployed  the  smartback  prototype  and monitored usage for a month in both corporate and home settings. the results show that the feature brings qualitative improvement to the browsing experience of individuals who use it.
