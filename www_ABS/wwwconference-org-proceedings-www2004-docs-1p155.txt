xml has become one of the core technologies for contemporary business  applications,  especially  web-based  applications.  to facilitate  processing  of  diverse  xml  data,  we  propose  an extensible,  integrated  xml  processing  architecture,  the  xml virtual  machine  (xvm),  which  connects  xml  data  with  their behaviors.  at the same time, the xvm is also a framework for developing  and  deploying  xml-based  applications.  using component-based the  xvm  supports  arbitrary granularity  and  provides  a  high  degree  of  modularity  and reusability.  xvm  components  are  dynamically  loaded  and composed  during  xml  data  processing.  using  the  xvm,  both client-side  and  server-side  xml  applications  can  be  developed and  deployed  in  an  integrated  way.  we  also  present  an  xml application container built on top of the xvm along with several sample applications to demonstrate the applicability of the xvm framework. techniques,
