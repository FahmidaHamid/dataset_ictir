with  the  proliferation  of  data  apis,  it  is  not  uncommon  that users  who  have  no  clear  ideas  about  data  apis  will  encounter difficulties to build mashups to satisfy their requirements. in this paper, we present a semantic-based mashup navigation system, smash  that  makes  mashup  building  easy  by  constructing  and visualizing  a  real-life  data  api  network.  we  build  a  sample network by gathering more than 300 popular apis and find that the relationships between them are so complex that our system will  play  an  important  role  in  navigating  users  and  give  them inspiration  to  build  interesting  mashups  easily.  the  system  is accessible at http//www.dart.zju.edu.cn/mashup.
