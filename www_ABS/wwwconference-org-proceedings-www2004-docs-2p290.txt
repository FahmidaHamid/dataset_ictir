in  this  paper,  we  describe  the  notion  of  a  semantic  information portal.  this  is  a  community  information  portal  that  exploits  the semantic  web  standards  to  improve  structure,  extensibility, customization  and  sustainability.  we  are  in  the  process  of developing  a  prototype  directory  of  environmental  organizations as  a  demonstration  of  the  approach  and  outline  the  design challenges involved and the current status of the work.
