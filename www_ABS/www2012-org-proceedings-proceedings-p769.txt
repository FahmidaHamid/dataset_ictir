micro-blogging services have become indispensable communication tools for online users for disseminating breaking news, eyewitness accounts, individual expression, and protest groups. recently, twitter, along with other online social networking services such as foursquare, gowalla, facebook and yelp, have started supporting location services in their messages, either explicitly, by letting users choose their places, or implicitly, by enabling geo-tagging, which is to associate messages with latitudes and longitudes. this functionality allows researchers to address an exciting set of questions 1) how is information created and shared across geographical locations, 2) how do spatial and linguistic characteristics of people vary across regions, and 3) how to model human mobility. although many attempts have been made for tackling these problems, previous methods are either complicated to be implemented or oversimpli ed that cannot yield reasonable performance. it is a challenge task to discover topics and identify users  interests from these geo-tagged messages due to the sheer amount of data and diversity of language variations used on these location sharing services. in this paper we focus on twitter and present an algorithm by modeling diversity in tweets based on topical diversity, geographical diversity, and an interest distribution of the user. furthermore, we take the markovian nature of a user s location into account. our model exploits sparse factorial coding of the attributes, thus allowing us to deal with a large and diverse set of covariates e ciently. our approach is vital for applications such as user pro ling, content recommendation and topic tracking. we show high accuracy in location estimation based on our model. moreover, the algorithm identi es interesting topics based on location and language.
