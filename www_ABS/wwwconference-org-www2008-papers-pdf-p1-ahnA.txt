personalized web search has emerged as one of the hottest topics for both the web industry and academic researchers. however, the majority  of  studies  on  personalized  search  focused  on  a  rather simple type of search, which leaves an important research topic   the  personalization  in  exploratory  searches     as  an  understudied area.  in  this  paper,  we  present  a  study  of  personalization  in  task-based  information  exploration  using  a  system  called  tasksieve. tasksieve is a web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based  profile,  called  a   task  model ,  for  personalization.  its innovations  include  flexible  and  user  controlled  integration  of queries  and  task  models,  task-infused  text  snippet  generation,  and onscreen visualization of task models. through an empirical study using  human  subjects  conducting  task-based  exploration  searches, we demonstrate that tasksieve pushes significantly more  relevant documents  to  the  top  of  search  result  lists  as  compared  to  a traditional search system. tasksieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks, allows the users to do so with higher productivity, and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics.
