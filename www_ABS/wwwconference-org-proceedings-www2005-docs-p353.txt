currently,  the  vast  majority  of  web  sites  do  not  support accessibility for visually impaired users. usually, these users have to  rely on screen readers applications that sequentially read the content of a web page in audio.  unfortunately, screen readers are not able to detect the meaning of the different page objects, and thus the presentation  of  the  page  is  lost.  one  approach  described  in literature  to  tackle  this  problem,  is  the  dante  approach,  which allows  semantic  annotation  of  web  pages  to  provide  screen readers  with  extra  (semantic)  knowledge  to  better  facilitate  the audio  presentation  of  a  web  page.    until  now,  such  annotations were done manually, and failed for dynamic pages. in this paper, we  combine  the  dante  approach  with  a  web  design  method, wsdm,  to  fully  automate  the  generation  of  the  semantic annotation  for  visually  impaired  users.  to  do  so,  the  semantic knowledge  gathered  during  the  design  process  is  exploited,  and the  annotations  are  generated  as  a  byproduct  of  the  design process, requiring no extra effort from the designer.
