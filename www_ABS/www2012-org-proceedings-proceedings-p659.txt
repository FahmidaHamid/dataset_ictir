widespread growth of open wireless hotspots has made it easy to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and impersonate web sites. although https can be used to prevent such attacks, its universal adoption is hindered by its performance cost and its inability to leverage caching at intermediate servers (such as cdn servers and caching proxies) while maintaining end-to-end security. to complement https, we revive an old idea from shttp, a protocol that offers end-to-end web integrity without con dential-ity. we name the protocol httpi and give it an ef cient design that is easy to deploy for today s web. in particular, we tackle several previously-unidenti ed challenges, such as supporting progressive page loading on the client s browser, handling mixed content, and de ning access control policies among http, httpi, and https content from the same domain. our prototyping and evaluation experience show that httpi incurs negligible performance overhead over http, can leverage existing web infrastructure such as cdns or caching proxies without any modi cations to them, and can make many of the mixed-content problems in existing https web sites easily go away. based on this experience, we advocate browser and web server vendors to adopt httpi.
