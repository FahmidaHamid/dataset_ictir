we introduce the problem of evaluating graph constraints in content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems. this problem formulation extends traditional content-based pub/sub systems in the following manner publishers and subscribers are connected via a (logical) directed graph g with node and edge constraints, which limits the set of valid paths between them. such graph constraints can be used to model a web advertising exchange (where there may be restrictions on how advertising networks can connect advertisers and publishers) and content delivery problems in social networks (where there may be restrictions on how information can be shared via the social graph). in this context, we develop e cient algorithms for evaluating graph constraints over arbitrary directed graphs g. we also present experimental results that demonstrate the e ectiveness and scal-ability of the proposed algorithms using a realistic dataset from yahoo! s web advertising exchange.
