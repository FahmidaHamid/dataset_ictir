portlets strive to play at the front end the same role that web services currently enjoy at the back end, namely, enablers of application assembly through reusable services. however, it is well-known in the component community that, the larger the component, the more reduced the reuse. hence, the coarse-grained nature of portlets (they encapsulate also the presentation layer) can jeopardize this vision of portlets as reusable services. to avoid this situation, this work proposes a perspective shift in portlet development by introducing the notion of consumer pro le. while the user pro le characterizes the end user (e.g. age, name, etc), the consumer pro le captures the idiosyncrasies of the organization through which the portlet is being delivered (e.g. the portal owner) as far as the portlet functionality is concerned. the user pro le can be dynamic and hence, requires the portlet to be customized at run-time. by contrast, the consumer pro le is known at registration time, and it is not always appropriate/possible to consider it at run-time. rather, it is better to customize the code at development time, and produce an organization-speci c portlet which builtin, custom functionality. in this scenario, we no longer have a portlet but a family of portlets, and the portlet provider becomes the  assembly line  of this family. this work promotes this vision by introducing an organization-aware, wsrp-compliant architecture that let portlet consumers registry and handle  family portlets  in the same way that  traditional portlets . in so doing, portlets are nearer to become truly reusable services.
