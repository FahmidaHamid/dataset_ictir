previous  studies  comparing  the  prediction  accuracy  of  effort models built using web cross and single-company data sets have been inconclusive, and as such replicated studies are necessary to determine  under  what  circumstances  a  company  can  place reliance on a cross-company effort model. this paper therefore replicates a previous study by investigating how  successful  a  cross-company  effort  model  is  i)  to    estimate effort for web projects that belong to a single company and were not  used  to  build  the  cross-company  model;  ii)  compared  to  a single-company  effort  model.  our  single-company  data  set  had data  on  15  web  projects  from  a  single  company  and  our  cross-company data set had data on 68 web projects from 25 different companies.  the  effort  estimates  used  in  our  analysis  were obtained  by  means  of  two  effort  estimation  techniques,  namely forward stepwise regression and case-based reasoning. our  results  were  similar  to  those  from  the  replicated  study, showing  that  predictions  based  on  the  single-company  model were  significantly  more  accurate  than  those  based  on  the  cross-company model.
