there is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently online, but it has been dif cult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. here we study this issue on twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network de ned by the interactions among twitter users. we  nd signi cant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in  stickiness,  the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of  persistence    the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have signi cant marginal effects. we  nd that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the  rst large-scale validation of the  complex contagion  principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. among other  ndings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the  rst exposure. we also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again  nding structural differences across topics. we develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.
