query suggestion, which enables the user to revise a query with a single click, has become one of the most fundamental features of web search engines. however, it is often dif cult for the user to choose from a list of query suggestions, and to understand the relation between an input query and suggested ones. in this paper, we propose a new method to present query suggestions to the user, which has been designed to help two popular query reformulation actions, namely, specialization (e.g. from  nikon  to  nikon camera  ) and parallel movement (e.g. from  nikon camera  to  canon camera ). using a query log collected from a popular commercial web search engine, our prototype called sparqs classi es query suggestions into automatically generated categories and generates a label for each category. moreover, sparqs presents some new entities as alternatives to the original query (e.g.  canon  in response to the query  nikon ), together with their query suggestions classi ed in the same way as the original query s suggestions. we conducted a task-based user study to compare sparqs with a traditional  at list  query suggestion interface. our results show that the sparqs interface enables subjects to search more successfully than the  at list case, even though query suggestions presented were exactly the same in the two interfaces. in addition, the subjects found the query suggestions more helpful when they were presented in the sparqs interface rather than in a  at list.
