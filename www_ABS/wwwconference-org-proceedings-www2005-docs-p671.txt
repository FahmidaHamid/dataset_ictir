this paper proposes an incremental maintenance algorithm that e ciently updates the materialized xpath/xslt views de ned using xpath expressions in xp {[], ,//,vars}. the algorithm consists of two processes. 1) the dynamic execution  ow of an xslt program is stored as an xt (xml transformation) tree during the full transformation. 2) in response to a source xml data update, the impacted portions of the xt-tree are identi ed and maintained by partially reevaluating the xslt program. this paper discusses the xpath/xslt features of incremental view maintenance for subtree insertion/deletion and applies them to the maintenance algorithm. experiments show that the incremental maintenance algorithm outperforms full xml transformation algorithms by factors of up to 500.
