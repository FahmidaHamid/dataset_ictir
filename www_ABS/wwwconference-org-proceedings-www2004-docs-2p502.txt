we present a gateway between the www and the gnutella peer-to-peer network that permits searchers on one side to be able to search and retrieve  les on the other side of the gateway. this work improves the accessibility of  les across different delivery platforms, making it possible to use a single search modality. we outline our design and implementation, present access statistics from a test deployment and discuss lessons learned.
