many  applications  in  analytical  domains  often  have  the  need  to  connect  the  dots   i.e.,  query  about  the  structure  of  data.  in bioinformatics  for  example,  it  is  typical  to  want  to  query  about interactions  between  proteins.  the  aim  of  such  queries  is  to  extract  relationships between entities i.e. paths from a data graph. often, such queries will specify certain constraints that qualifying results must satisfy e.g. paths involving a set of mandatory nodes. unfortunately,  most  present  day  semantic  web  query  languages including  the  current  draft  of  the  anticipated  recommendation sparql,  lack  the  ability  to  express  queries  about  arbitrary  path structures  in  data.  in  addition,  many  systems  that  support  some limited form of path queries rely on main memory graph algorithms limiting their applicability to very large scale graphs. in this paper, we present an approach for supporting path extraction queries.  our  proposal  comprises  (i)  a  query  language  sparq2l which  extends  sparql  with  path  variables  and  path  variable constraint expressions, and (ii) a novel query evaluation framework based  on  efficient  algebraic  techniques  for  solving  path  problems which  allows  for  path  queries  to  be  efficiently  evaluated  on  disk resident  rdf  graphs.  the  effectiveness  of  our  proposal  is demonstrated by a performance evaluation of our approach on both real world and synthetic datasets.
