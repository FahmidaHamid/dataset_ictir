the  web  graph  follows  the  power  law  distribution  and  has  a hierarchy structure. but neither the pagerank algorithm nor any of  its  improvements  leverage  these  attributes.  in  this  paper,  we propose  a  novel link  analysis  algorithm   the  powerrank algorithm ,  which  makes  use  of  the  power  law  distribution attribute  and  the  hierarchy  structure  of  the  web  graph.  the algorithm consists two parts. in the first part, special treatment is applied  to  the  web  pages  with  low   importance   score.  in  the second part, the global  importance  score for each web page is obtained  by  combining  those  scores  together.  our  experimental results  show  that  1)  the  powerrank  algorithm  computes 10%~30% faster than pagerank algorithm. 2) top web pages in powerrank  algorithm  remain  similar  to  that  of  the  pagerank algorithm.
