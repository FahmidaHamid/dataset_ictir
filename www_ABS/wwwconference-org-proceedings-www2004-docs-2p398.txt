we propose a method of automatically constructing web content from video streams with metadata that we call tv2web. the web content includes thumbnails of video units and caption data generated from metadata. users can watch tv on a normal web browser. they can also manipulate web content with zooming metaphors to seamlessly alter the level of detail (lod) of the content being viewed. they can search for favorite scenes faster than with analog video equipment, and experience a new cross-media environment. we also developed a prototype of the tv2web system and discuss its implementation.
