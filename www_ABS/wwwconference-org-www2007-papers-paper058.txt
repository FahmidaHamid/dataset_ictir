finding  relationships  between  entities  on  the  web,  e.g.,  the connections  between  different  places  or  the  commonalities  of people, is a novel and challenging problem. existing web search engines  excel  in  keyword  matching  and  document  ranking,  but they  cannot  well  handle  many  relationship  queries.  this  paper proposes a new method for answering relationship queries on two entities. our method first respectively retrieves the top web pages for either entity from a web search engine. it then  matches these web pages and generates an ordered list of web page pairs. each web page pair consists of one web page for either entity. the top ranked  web  page  pairs  are  likely  to  contain  the  relationships between  the  two  entities.  one  main  challenge  in  the  ranking process is to effectively filter out the large amount of noise in the web  pages  without  losing  much  useful  information.  to  achieve this,  our  method  assigns  appropriate  weights  to  terms  in  web pages  and  intelligently  identifies  the  potential  connecting  terms that capture the relationships between the two entities. only those top potential connecting terms with large weights are used to rank web  page  pairs.  finally,  the  top  ranked  web  page  pairs  are presented to the searcher. for each such pair, the query terms and the top potential connecting terms are properly highlighted so that the relationships between the two entities can be easily identified. we implemented a prototype on top of the google search engine and  evaluated  it  under  a  wide  variety  of  query  scenarios.  the experimental results show that  our  method is  effective  at finding important relationships with low overhead.
