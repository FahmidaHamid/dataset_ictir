this  paper  is  concerned  with  rank  aggregation,  the  task  of combining the ranking results of individual rankers at meta-search. previously,  rank  aggregation  was  performed  mainly  by  means  of unsupervised learning. to further enhance ranking accuracies, we propose employing supervised learning to perform the task, using labeled  data.  we  refer  to  the  approach  as   supervised  rank aggregation .  we  set  up  a  general  framework  for  conducting supervised rank aggregation, in which learning is formalized an optimization  which  minimizes  disagreements  between  ranking results  and  the  labeled  data.  as  case  study,  we  focus  on  markov chain based  rank  aggregation  in this paper.  the  optimization  for markov  chain  based  methods  is  not  a  convex  optimization problem,  however,  and  thus  is  hard  to  solve.  we  prove  that  we can  transform  the  optimization  problem  into  that  of  semidefinite programming  and  solve  it  efficiently.  experimental  results  on meta-searches  show  that  supervised  rank  aggregation  can significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods.
