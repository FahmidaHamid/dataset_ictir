the  emergence  of  personalized  homepage  services,  e.g. personalized  google  homepage  and  microsoft  windows  live, has enabled web users to select web contents of interest and to aggregate them in a single web page. the web contents are often predefined  content  blocks  provided  by  the  service  providers. however,  it  involves  intensive  manual  efforts  to  define  the content blocks and  maintain  the  information  in  it.  in  this  paper, we  propose  a  novel  personalized  homepage  system,  called  homepage  live ,  to  allow  end  users  to  use  drag-and-drop actions to collect their favorite web content blocks from existing web  pages  and  organize  them  in  a  single  page.  moreover, homepage live automatically traces the changes of blocks with the evolvement of the container pages by measuring the tree edit distance  of  the  selected  blocks.  by  exploiting  the  immutable elements  of  web  pages,  the  tracing  algorithm  performance  is significantly improved. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
