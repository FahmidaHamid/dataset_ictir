the current discussion about a future semantic web trust architecture  is  focused  on  reputational  trust  mechanisms  based  on explicit trust ratings. what is often overlooked is the fact that, besides  of  ratings,  huge  parts  of  the  application-specific  data published on the semantic web are also trust relevant and therefore can be used for flexible, fine-grained trust evaluations. in this poster  we  propose  the  usage  of  context  and  content-based  trust mechanisms and outline a trust architecture which allows the formulation  of  subjective  and  task-specific  trust  policies  as  a combination  of  reputation,  context  and  content-based  trust mechanisms.
