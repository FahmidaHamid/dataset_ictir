we explore new ways of improving a search engine using data from web 2.0 applications such as blogs and social bookmarks. this data contains entities such as documents, people and tags, and relationships between them. we propose a simple yet e ective method, based on faceted search, that treats all entities in a uni ed manner returning all of them (documents, people and tags) on every search, and allowing all of them to be used as search terms. we describe an implementation of such a social search engine on the intranet of a large enterprise, and present large-scale experiments which verify the validity of our approach.
