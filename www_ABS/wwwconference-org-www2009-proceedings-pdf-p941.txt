collaborative browsing, or co-browsing, is the co-navigation of the web  with  other  people  at-a-distance,  supported  by  software  that takes  care  of  synchronizing  the  browsers.  current  state-of-the-art solutions are able to do co-browsing of  static web pages , and do not support the synchronization of javascript interactions. however, currently  many  web  pages  use  javascript  and  ajax  techniques  to create  highly  dynamic  and  interactive  web  applications.  in  this paper,  we  describe  two  approaches  for  co-browsing  that  both support the synchronization of the javascript and ajax interactions of dynamic web pages.  one approach is based on synchronizing the output  of  the  javascript  engine  by  sending  over  the  changes  made on the dom tree. the other approach is based on synchronizing the input  of  the  javascript  engine  by  synchronizing  ui  events  and incoming  data.  since  the  latter  solution  offers  a  better  user experience and is more scalable, it is elaborated in more detail. an important aspect of both approaches is that they operate at the dom level.  therefore,  the  client-side  can  be  implemented  in  javascript and no browser extensions are required. to the best of the authors  knowledge this is the first dom-level co-browsing solution that also enables co-browsing of the dynamic interaction parts of web pages. the  presented  co-browsing  solution  has  been  implemented  in  a research  demonstrator  which  allows  users  to  do  co-browsing  of web-applications on browser-based networked televisions.
