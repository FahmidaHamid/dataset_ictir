flash, as a multimedia format, becomes more and more popular on the web. however, previous works on flash are totally based on low-level features,  which  make  it  unpractical  to  build  a  content-based  flash  search  engine.  to  address  this  problem,  our  paper proposes expressive semantics for bridging the gap between low-level  features  and  user  queries.  to  smoothly incorporate expressive  semantics  into  a  search  engine,  an  eigenvector-based model is devised to map a user query to expressive semantics with the  aid  of  link  analysis  method.  our  experiment  results  confirm that  expressive to understanding and hence searching flash movies more efficiently. categories & subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval] information search and retrieval   retrieval models, search process, selection process.
