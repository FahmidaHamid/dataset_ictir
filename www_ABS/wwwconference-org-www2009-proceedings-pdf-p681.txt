users of social networking services can connect with each other by forming communities for online interaction. yet as the number of communities hosted by such websites grows over time, users have even greater need for e ective community recommendations in order to meet more users. in this paper, we investigate two algorithms from very di erent domains and evaluate their e ectiveness for personalized community recommendation. first is association rule mining (arm), which discovers associations between sets of communities that are shared across many users. second is latent dirichlet allocation (lda), which models user-community co-occurrences using latent aspects. in comparing lda with arm, we are interested in discovering whether modeling low-rank latent structure is more e ective for recommendations than directly mining rules from the observed data. we experiment on an orkut data set consisting of 492, 104 users and 118, 002 communities. our empirical comparisons using the top-k recommendations metric show that lda performs consistently better than arm for the community recommendation task when recommending a list of 4 or more communities. however, for recommendation lists of up to 3 communities, arm is still a bit better. we analyze examples of the latent information learned by lda to explain this  nding. to e ciently handle the large-scale data set, we parallelize lda on distributed computers [1] and demonstrate our parallel implementation s scalability with varying numbers of machines.
