we present an algorithm for updating the pagerank vector [1]. due to the scale of the web, google only updates its famous pagerank vector on a monthly basis. however, the web changes much more frequently. drastically speeding the pagerank computation can lead to fresher, more accurate rankings of the webpages retrieved by search engines. it can also make the goal of real-time personalized rankings within reach. on two small subsets of the web, our algorithm updates pagerank using just 25% and 14%, respectively, of the time required by the original pagerank algorithm. our algorithm uses iterative aggregation techniques [7, 8] to focus on the slow-converging states of the markov chain. the most exciting feature of this algorithm is that it can be joined with other pagerank acceleration methods, such as the dangling node lumpability algorithm [6], quadratic extrapolation [4], and adaptive pagerank [3], to realize even greater speedups (potentially a factor of 60 or more speedup when all algorithms are combined).
