online social networks, such as facebook, are increasingly utilized by many users. these networks allow people to publish details about themselves and connect to their friends. some of the information revealed inside these networks is private and it is possible that corporations could use learning algorithms on the released data to predict undisclosed private information. in this paper, we explore how to launch inference attacks using released social networking data to predict undisclosed private information about individuals. we then explore the e ectiveness of possible sanitization techniques that can be used to combat such inference attacks under di erent scenarios.
