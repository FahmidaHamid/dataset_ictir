web authoring environments enable end-users to create applications that integrate information from other web sources. users can create web sites that include builtin components to dynamically incorporate, for example, weather information, stock-quotes, or the latest news from di erent web sources. recent surveys conducted among end-users have indicated an increasing interest in creating such applications. unfortunately, web authoring environments do not provide support beyond a limited set of builtin components. this work addresses this limitation by providing end-user support for  clipping  information from a target web site to incorporate it into the end-user site. the support consists of a mechanism to identify the target clipping with multiple markers to increase robustness, and a dynamic assessment of the retrieved information to quantify its reliability. the clipping approach has been integrated as a feature into a popular web authoring tool on which we present the results of two preliminary studies.
