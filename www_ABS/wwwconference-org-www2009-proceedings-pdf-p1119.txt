a soft error redirection is a url redirection to a page that returns the http status code 200 (ok) but has actually no relevant content to the client request. since such redi-rections degrade the performance of web search engines in many ways, it is highly desirable to remove as many of them as possible. we propose a novel approach to detect soft error redirections by analyzing redirection logs collected during crawling operation. experimental results on huge crawl data show that our measure can classify soft error redirec-tions e ectively.
