the  problem  of  question the  paper recommendation. specifically, given a question as query, we are to retrieve and rank other questions according to their likelihood of being good recommendations of the queried question. a good recommendation  provides  alternative  aspects  around  users  interest.  we  tackle  the  problem  of  question  recommendation  in two steps first represent questions as graphs of topic terms, and then  rank  recommendations  on  the  basis  of  the  graphs.  we formalize both steps as the tree-cutting problems and then employ the  mdl  (minimum  description  length)  for  selecting  the  best cuts.  experiments  have  been  conducted  with  the  real  questions posted at yahoo! answers. the questions are about two domains,  travel  and  computers & internet . experimental results indicate that  the  use  of  the  mdl-based  tree  cut  model  can  significantly outperform the baseline methods of word-based vsm or phrase-based vsm. the results also show that the use of the mdl-based tree cut model is essential to our approach.
