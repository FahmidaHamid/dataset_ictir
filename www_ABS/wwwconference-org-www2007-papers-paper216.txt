continuous  queries  are  used  to  monitor  changes  to time varying data  and  to  provide  results  useful  for  online  decision  making. typically  a  user  desires  to  obtain  the  value of some aggregation function over distributed data items, for example, to know (a) the average of temperatures sensed by a set of sensors (b) the value of index  of  mid-cap  stocks.  in  these  queries  a  client  specifies  a coherency  requirement  as  part  of  the  query.  in  this  paper  we present  a  low-cost,  scalable  technique  to  answer  continuous aggregation  queries  using  a  content  distribution  network  of dynamic data items. in such a network of data aggregators, each data aggregator serves a set of data items at specific coherencies. just  as  various  fragments  of  a  dynamic  webpage  are  served  by one  or  more  nodes  of  a  content  distribution  network,  our technique  involves  decomposing  a  client  query  into  sub-queries and executing sub-queries on judiciously chosen data aggregators with their individual sub-query incoherency bounds. we provide a technique  of  getting  the  optimal  query  plan  (i.e.,  set  of  sub-queries  and  their  chosen  data  aggregators)  which  satisfies  client query s coherency requirement with least cost, measured in terms of  the  number  of  refresh  messages  sent  from  aggregators  to  the client. for estimating query execution cost, we build a continuous query  cost  model  which  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  number  of messages  required  to  satisfy  the  client  specified  incoherency bound. performance results using real-world traces show that our cost  based  query  planning  leads  to  queries being executed using less  than  one  third  the  number  of  messages  required  by  existing schemes.
