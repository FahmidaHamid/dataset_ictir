the  ability  of  the  web  to  share  data  regardless  of  geographical location  raises  a  new  issue  called  remote  authoring.  with  the internet  and  web  browsers  being  independent  of  hardware,  it becomes  possible  to  build  web-enabled  database  applications. many approaches are provided to integrate databases into the web environment, which use the web's protocol, i.e., http to transfer the data between clients and servers. however, those methods are affected by the http shortfalls with regard to remote authoring. this  paper  introduces  and  discusses  a  new  methodology  for remote  authoring  of  databases,  which  is  based  on  the  webdav protocol. it is a seamless and effective methodology for accessing and  authoring  databases,  particularly  in  that  it  naturally  benefits from  the  webdav  advantages  such  as  metadata  and  access control.  these  features  establish  a  standard  way  of  accessing database  metadata,  and  increase  the  database  security,  while speeding up the database connection.
