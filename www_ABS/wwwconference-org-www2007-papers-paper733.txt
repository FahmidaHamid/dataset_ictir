this  paper  is  concerned  with  the  problem  of  browsing  social annotations.  today,  a  lot  of  services  (e.g.,  del.icio.us,  filckr) have been provided for helping users to manage and  share  their favorite urls and photos based on social annotations. due to the exponential increasing of the social annotations, more  and  more users,  however,  are  facing  the  problem  how  to  effectively  find desired  resources  from  large  annotation  data.  existing  methods such  as  tag  cloud  and  annotation  matching  work  well  only  on small  annotation  sets.  thus,  an  effective  approach  for  browsing large scale annotation sets and the associated resources is in great demand  by  both  ordinary  users  and  service  providers.  in  this paper,  we  propose  a  novel  algorithm,  namely  effective  large scale  annotation  browser  (elsaber),  to  browse  large-scale social  annotation  data.  elsaber  helps  the  users  browse  huge number  of  annotations  in  a  semantic,  hierarchical  and  efficient way. more specifically, elsaber has the following features 1) the  semantic  relations  between  annotations  are  explored  for browsing  of  similar  resources;  2)  the  hierarchical  relations between annotations are constructed for browsing in a top-down fashion;  3)  the  distribution  of  social  annotations  is  studied  for efficient  browsing.  by  incorporating  the  personal  and  time information,  elsaber  can  be  further  extended  for  personalized and  time-related  browsing.  a  prototype  system  is  implemented and shows promising results.
