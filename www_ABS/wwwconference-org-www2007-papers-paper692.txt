we present a content-driven reputation system for wikipedia authors. in our system, authors gain reputation when the edits they perform to wikipedia articles are preserved by subsequent authors, and they lose reputation when their edits are rolled back or undone in short order. thus, author reputation is computed solely on the basis of content evolution; user-to-user comments or ratings are not used. the author reputation we compute could be used to  ag new contributions from low-reputation authors, or it could be used to allow only authors with high reputation to contribute to controversial or critical pages. a reputation system for the wikipedia could also provide an incentive for high-quality contributions. we have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to analyze the entire italian and french wikipedias, consisting of a total of 691,551 pages and 5,587,523 revisions. our results show that our notion of reputation has good predictive value changes performed by low-reputation authors have a signi cantly larger than average probability of having poor quality, as judged by human observers, and of being later undone, as measured by our algorithms.
