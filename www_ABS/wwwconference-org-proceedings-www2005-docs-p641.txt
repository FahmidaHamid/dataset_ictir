to exploit the similarity information hidden in the hyperlink structure of the web, this paper introduces algorithms scalable to graphs with billions of vertices on a distributed architecture. the similarity of multi-step neighborhoods of vertices are numerically evaluated by similarity functions including simrank [20], a recursive re nement of cocitation; psimrank, a novel variant with better theoretical characteristics; and the jaccard coe cient, extended to multi-step neighborhoods. our methods are presented in a general framework of monte carlo similarity search algorithms that precompute an index database of random  ngerprints, and at query time, similarities are estimated from the  nger-prints. the performance and quality of the methods were tested on the stanford webbase [19] graph of 80m pages by comparing our scores to similarities extracted from the odp directory [26]. our experimental results suggest that the hyperlink structure of vertices within four to  ve steps provide more adequate information for similarity search than single-step neighborhoods.
