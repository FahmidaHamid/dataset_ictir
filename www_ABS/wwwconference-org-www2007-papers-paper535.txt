understanding the extent to which people s search behaviors differ in  terms  of  the  interaction  flow  and  information  targeted  is important  in  designing  interfaces  to  help  world  wide  web  users search  more  effectively.    in  this  paper  we  describe  a  longitudinal log-based study that investigated variability in  people s interaction behavior when engaged in search-related activities on the web.  we analyze the search interactions of more than two thousand volunteer users  over  a  five-month  period,  with  the  aim  of  characterizing differences  in  their  interaction  styles.    the  findings  of  our  study suggest  that  there  are  dramatic  differences  in  variability  in  key aspects of the interaction within and between users, and within and between the search queries they submit.  our findings also suggest two  classes  of  extreme  user    navigators  and  explorers    whose search  interaction  is  highly  consistent  or  highly  variable.    lessons learned  from  these  users  can  inform  the  design  of  tools  to  support effective web-search interactions for everyone.
