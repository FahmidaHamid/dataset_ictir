to deal with the problem of empty or too little answers returned from  a  web  database  in  response  to  a  user  query,  this  paper proposes a novel approach to provide relevant and ranked query results. based on the user original query, we speculate how much the  user  cares  about  each  specified  attribute  and  assign  a corresponding weight to it. this original query is then rewritten as an  approximate  query  by  relaxing  the  query  criteria  range.  the relaxation order of all specified attributes and the relaxed degree on each specified attribute are varied with the attribute weights. for the approximate query results, we generate users  contextual preferences  from  database  workload  and  use  them  to  create  a priori  orders  of  tuples  in  an  offline  preprocessing  step.  only  a few representative orders are saved, each corresponding to a set of contexts.  then,  these  orders  and  associated  contexts  are  used  at query time to expeditiously provide ranked answers. results of a preliminary user study demonstrate that our query relaxation and results  ranking  methods  can  capture  the  user s  preferences effectively.  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  our  approach  is also demonstrated by experimental result.
