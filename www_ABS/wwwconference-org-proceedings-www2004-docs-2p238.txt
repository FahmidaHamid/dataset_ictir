nowadays,  the  leading  e-learning  platforms  are  converging towards  standardization.  this paper presents an extension to the scorm,  today s  most  well  acclaimed  e-learning  standard, enabling  the  modelling  of  course  related  entities  that  surround learning objects and content aggregations, therefore increasing the standard s  modelling scope and allowing for gains in efficiency in  knowledge  dissemination.  a  prototype  is  being  implemented and  tested  on  vianet,  an  original  e-learning  platform  with extensible support for the scorm.
