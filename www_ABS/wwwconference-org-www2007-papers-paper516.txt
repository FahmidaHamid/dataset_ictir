web-based communities have become important places for people to  seek  and  share  expertise.  we  find  that  networks  in  these communities  typically  differ  in  their  topology  from  other  online networks  such  as  the  world  wide  web.  systems  targeted  to augment  web-based  communities  by  automatically  identifying users with expertise, for example, need to adapt to the underlying interaction dynamics. in this study, we analyze the java forum, a large  online  help-seeking  community,  using  social  network analysis  methods.    we  test  a  set  of  network-based  ranking algorithms,  including  pagerank  and  hits,  on  this  large  size social  network  in  order  to  identify  users  with  high  expertise.  we then  use  simulations  to  identify  a  small  number  of  simple simulation  rules  governing  the  question-answer  dynamic  in  the network.  these  simple  rules  not  only  replicate  the  structural characteristics  and  algorithm  performance  on  the  empirically observed  java  forum,  but  also  allow  us  to  evaluate  how  other algorithms  may  perform in  communities  with  different characteristics.  we  believe  this  approach  will  be  fruitful  for practical  algorithm  design  and for  online expertise-sharing communities. implementation
