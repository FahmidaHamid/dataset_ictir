the  digital  generation  of  a  story  in  which  users  have  influence over  the  narrative  is  emerging  as  an  exciting  example  of computer-based interactive entertainment. interactive storytelling has existed in non digital versions for thousand of years, but with the  advent  of  the  web  the  demand  for  enabling  distributed cyberdrama  generation  is  becoming  increasingly  common.  to govern the complexity stemming from the distributed generation of  complex  plots,  we  have  devised  an  event  synchronization service  that  may  be  exploited  to  support  the  distribution  of interactive storytelling activities over the web. the main novelty of  our  approach  is  that  the  semantics  of  the  cyberdrama  is exploited  to  discard  obsolete  events.  this  brings  to  the  positive result  of  speeding  up  the  activity  of  drama  generation,  thus enabling an augmented interactivity among dispersed players.
