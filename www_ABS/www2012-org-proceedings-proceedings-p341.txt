with the recent advances in information networks, the problem of community detection has attracted much attention in the last decade. while network community detection has been ubiquitous, the task of collecting complete network data remains challenging in many real-world applications. usually the collected network is incomplete with most of the edges missing. commonly, in such networks, all nodes with attributes are available while only the edges within a few local regions of the network can be observed. in this paper, we study the problem of detecting communities in incomplete information networks with missing edges. we  rst learn a distance metric to reproduce the link-based distance between nodes from the observed edges in the local information regions. we then use the learned distance metric to estimate the distance between any pair of nodes in the network. a hierarchical clustering approach is proposed to detect communities within the incomplete information networks. empirical studies on real-world information networks demonstrate that our proposed method can e ectively detect community structures within incomplete information networks.
