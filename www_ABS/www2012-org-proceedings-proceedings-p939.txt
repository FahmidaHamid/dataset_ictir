labeling human faces in images contained in web media stories enables enriching the user experience o ered by media sites. we propose a lightweight framework for automatic image annotation that exploits named entities mentioned in the article to signi cantly boost the accuracy of face recognition. while previous works in the area labor to train comprehensive o ine visual models for a pre-de ned universe of candidates, our approach models the people mentioned in a given story on the  y, using a standard web image search engine as an image sampling mechanism. we overcome multiple sources of noise introduced by this ad-hoc process, to build a fast and robust end-to-end system from o -the-shelf error-prone text analysis and machine vision components. in experiments conducted on approximately 900 faces depicted in 500 stories from a major celebrity news website, we were able to correctly label 81.5% of the faces while mislabeling 14.8% of them.
