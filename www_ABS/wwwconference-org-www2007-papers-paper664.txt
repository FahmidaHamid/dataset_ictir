information flows in a network where individuals influence each  other.    the  diffusion  rate  captures  how  efficiently  the information  can  diffuse  among  the  users  in  the  network.    we propose an information flow model that leverages diffusion rates for (1) prediction   identify where information should flow to, and (2) ranking   identify who will most quickly receive the information. for prediction, we measure how likely information will propagate from a specific sender to a specific receiver during a certain time period.  accordingly  a  rate-based  recommendation  algorithm  is proposed that predicts who will most likely receive the information during  a  limited  time  period.    for  ranking,  we  estimate  the expected time for information diffusion to reach a specific user in a  network.  subsequently,  a  diffusionrank  algorithm  is  proposed that ranks users based on how quickly information will flow to them. experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed  algorithms the  recommendation performance and rank users by the efficiency of information flow.
