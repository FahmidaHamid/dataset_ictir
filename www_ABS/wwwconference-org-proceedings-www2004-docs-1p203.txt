previous  work  shows  that  a  web  page  can  be  partitioned  into multiple  segments  or  blocks,  and  often  the  importance  of  those blocks in a page is not equivalent. also, it  has  been  proven  that differentiating  noisy  or  unimportant  blocks  from  pages  can facilitate  web  mining,  search  and  accessibility.  however,  no uniform  approach  and  model  has  been  presented  to  measure  the importance  of  different  segments  in  web  pages.  through  a  user study, we found that people do have a consistent view about the importance of blocks in web pages. in this paper, we investigate how to find a model to automatically assign importance values to blocks in a web page. we define the block importance estimation as  a  learning  problem.  first,  we  use  a  vision-based  page segmentation  algorithm  to  partition  a  web  page  into  semantic blocks with a hierarchical structure. then spatial features (such as position  and  size)  and  content  features  (such  as  the  number  of images  and  links)  are  extracted  to  construct  a  feature  vector  for each block. based on these features, learning algorithms are used to train a model to assign importance to different segments in the web  page.  in  our  experiments,  the  best  model  can  achieve  the performance  with  micro-f1  79%  and  micro-accuracy  85.9%, which is quite close to a person s view.
