today s web becomes a platform for services to be dynamically interconnected to produce a desired outcome. it is important to formalize  the  semantics  of  the  contextual  elements  of  web services.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  novel  technique  called semantic  genome  propagation  scheme  (sgps)  for  measuring similarity  between  semantic  concepts.  we  show  how  sgps  is used  to  compute  a  multidimensional  similarity  between  two services.  we  evaluate  the  sgps  similarity  measurement  in terms of the similarity performance and scalability.
