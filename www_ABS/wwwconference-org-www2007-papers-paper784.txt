search engine advertising has become a significant element of the web  browsing  experience.  choosing  the  right  ads  for  the  query and the order in which they are displayed greatly affects the probability that a user will see and click on each ad. this ranking has a strong impact on the revenue the search engine receives from the ads.  further,  showing  the  user  an  ad  that  they  prefer  to  click  on improves user satisfaction. for these reasons, it is important to be able  to  accurately  estimate  the  click-through  rate  of  ads  in  the system. for ads that have been displayed repeatedly, this is empirically measurable, but for new ads, other means must be used. we show  that  we  can  use  features  of  ads,  terms,  and  advertisers  to learn  a  model  that  accurately  predicts  the  click-though  rate  for new  ads.  we  also  show  that  using  our  model  improves  the  convergence  and  performance  of  an  advertising  system.  as  a  result, our model increases both revenue and user satisfaction.
