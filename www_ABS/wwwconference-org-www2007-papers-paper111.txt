spammers  use  questionable  search  engine  optimization  (seo) techniques to promote their spam links into top search results. in this paper, we focus on one prevalent type of spam   redirection spam     where  one  can  identify  spam  pages  by  the  third-party domains  that  these  pages  redirect  traffic  to.  we  propose  a  five-layer, double-funnel model for describing end-to-end redirection spam,  present  a  methodology  for  analyzing  the  layers,  and identify  prominent  domains  on  each  layer  using  two  sets  of commercial  keywords     one  targeting  spammers  and  the  other targeting advertisers. the methodology and findings are useful for search  engines  to  strengthen  their  ranking  algorithms  against spam,  for  legitimate  website  owners  to  locate and remove spam to doorway  pages,  and  for identify unscrupulous syndicators who serve ads on spam pages.
