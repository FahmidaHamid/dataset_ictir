the development of user interfaces (uis) is one of the most time-consuming  aspects  in  software  development.  in  this  context,  the lack of proper reuse mechanisms for uis is increasingly becoming manifest,  especially  as  software  development  is  more  and  more moving toward composite applications. in this paper we propose a framework  for integration  of  standalone  modules  or applications,  where  integration  occurs  at  the  presentation  layer. hence,  the  final  goal  is  to  reduce  the  effort  required  for  ui development by maximizing reuse. the the  design  of  the  framework  is  inspired  by  lessons  learned  from application  integration,  appropriately  modified  to  account  for  the specificity of the ui integration problem. we provide an abstract component  model  to  specify  characteristics  and  behaviors  of presentation components and propose an event-based composition model  to  specify  the  composition  logic.  components  and composition  are  described  by  means  of  a  simple  xml-based language,  which  is  interpreted  by  a  runtime  middleware  for  the execution  of  the  resulting  composite  application.  a  proof-of-concept prototype allows us to show that the proposed component model  can  also  easily  be  applied  to  existing  presentation components,  built  with  different  languages  and/or  component technologies.
