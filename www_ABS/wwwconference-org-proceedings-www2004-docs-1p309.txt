the celebrated pagerank algorithm has proved to be a very effective paradigm for ranking results of web search algorithms. in this paper we re ne this basic paradigm to take into account several evolving prominent features of the web, and propose several algorithmic innovations. first, we analyze features of the rapidly growing  frontier  of the web, namely the part of the web that crawlers are unable to cover for one reason or another. we analyze the effect of these pages and  nd it to be signi cant. we suggest ways to improve the quality of ranking by modeling the growing presence of  link rot  on the web as more sites and pages fall out of maintenance. finally we suggest new methods of ranking that are motivated by the hierarchical structure of the web, are more ef cient than pagerank, and may be more resistant to direct manipulation.
