with the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as tour  guide  and  location-based  social  network,  we  now  have accumulated  many  location  data  on  the  web.  in  this  paper,  we show  that,  by  using  the  location  data  based  on  gps  and  users  comments  at  various  locations,  we  can  discover  interesting locations  and  possible  activities  that  can  be  performed  there  for recommendations.  our  research  is  highlighted  in  the  following location-related  queries  in  our  daily  life  1)  if  we  want  to  do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as  beijing,  where  should  we  go?  2)  if  we  have  already  visited some places such as the bird s nest building in beijing s olympic park, what else can we do there? by using our system, for the first question,  we  can  recommend  her  to  visit  a  list  of  interesting locations  such  as  tiananmen  square,  bird s  nest,  etc.  for  the second question, if the user visits bird s nest, we can recommend her to not only do sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor exercise  facilities  or  try  some  nice food  nearby.  to  achieve this goal, we first model the users  location and activity histories that we take as input. we then mine knowledge, such as the location features  and  activity-activity  correlations  from  the  geographical databases  and  the  web,  to  gather  additional  inputs.  finally,  we apply a collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting locations and activities, and use them to recommend to the users where  they  can  visit  if  they  want  to  perform  some  specific activities and what they can do if they visit some specific places. we  empirically  evaluated  our  system  using  a  large  gps  dataset collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. we extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.
