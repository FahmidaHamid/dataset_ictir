we propose a new way of browsing contextualized-news articles. our prototype browser system is called a time-based contextualized-news browser (t-cnb). the t-cnb concurrently and automatically presents a series of related pages for one news source while browsing the user-speci ed page. it extracts the past related pages from a user-speci ed news articles on the web. the related pages outline the progress of user-speci ed news articles. we call the related pages  contextual pages . using the t-cnb, a user only needs to specify one news article on the web. the user then automatically receives past related news articles, which provide a wider understanding of the topic. the t-cnb automatically generates and presents contextualized news articles.
