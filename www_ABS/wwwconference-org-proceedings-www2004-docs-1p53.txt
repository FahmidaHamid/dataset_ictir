a scalable approach to trust negotiation is required in web service environments that have large and dynamic requester populations. we introduce trust-serv, a model-driven trust negotiation framework for web services. the framework employs a model for trust negotiation that is based on state machines, extended with security abstractions. our policy model supports lifecycle management, an important trait in the dynamic environments that characterize web services. in particular, we provide a set of change operations to modify policies, and migration strategies that permit ongoing negotiations to be migrated to new policies without being disrupted. experimental results show the performance bene t of these strategies. the proposed approach has been implemented as a container-centric mechanism that is transparent to the web services and to the developers of web services, simplifying web service development and management as well as enabling scalable deployments.
