the web o ers rich relational data with di erent semantics. in this paper, we address the problem of document recommendation in a digital library, where the documents in question are networked by citations and are associated with other entities by various relations. due to the sparsity of a single graph and noise in graph construction, we propose a new method for combining multiple graphs to measure document similarities, where di erent factorization strategies are used based on the nature of di erent graphs. in particular, the new method seeks a single low-dimensional embedding of documents that captures their relative similarities in a latent space. based on the obtained embedding, a new recommendation framework is developed using semi-supervised learning on graphs. in addition, we address the scalability issue and propose an incremental algorithm. the new incremental method signi cantly improves the e ciency by calculating the embedding for new incoming documents only. the new batch and incremental methods are evaluated on two real world datasets prepared from citeseer. experiments demonstrate signi cant quality improvement for our batch method and signi cant e ciency improvement with tolerable quality loss for our incremental method.
