relational autocorrelation is ubiquitous in relational domains. this observed correlation between class labels of linked instances in a network (e.g., two friends are more likely to share political beliefs than two randomly selected people) can be due to the e ects of two di erent social processes. if social in uence e ects are present, instances are likely to change their attributes to conform to their neighbor values. if homophily e ects are present, instances are likely to link to other individuals with similar attribute values. both these e ects will result in autocorrelated attribute values. when analyzing static relational networks it is impossible to determine how much of the observed correlation is due each of these factors. however, the recent surge of interest in social networks has increased the availability of dynamic network data. in this paper, we present a randomization technique for temporal network data where the attributes and links change over time. given data from two time steps, we measure the gain in correlation and assess whether a signi cant portion of this gain is due to in uence and/or homophily. we demonstrate the e cacy of our method on semi-synthetic data and then apply the method to a real-world social networks dataset, showing the impact of both in uence and homophily e ects.
