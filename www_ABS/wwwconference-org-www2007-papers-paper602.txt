over  the  last  five  years,  a  range  of  projects  have  focused  on progressively  more  elaborated  techniques  for  adaptive  news delivery.  however,  the  adaptation  process  in  these  systems  has become more complicated and thus less transparent to the users. in  this  paper,  we  concentrate  on  the  application  of  open  user models  in  adding  transparency  and  controllability  to  adaptive news  systems.  we  present  a  personalized  news  system, yournews,  which  allows  users  to  view  and  edit  their  interest profiles,  and  report  a  user  study  on  the  system.  our  results confirm that users prefer transparency and control in their systems, and  generate  more  trust  to  such  systems.  however,  similar  to previous  studies,  our  study  demonstrate  that  this  ability  to  edit user profiles may also harm the system s performance and has to be used with caution.
