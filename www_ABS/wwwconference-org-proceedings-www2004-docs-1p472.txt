we  address  the  problem  of  integrating  objects  from  a  source taxonomy  into  a  master  taxonomy.  this  problem  is  not  only currently  pervasive  on  the  web,  but  also  important  to  the emerging  semantic  web.  a  straightforward  approach to automating  this  process  would  be  to  train  a  classifier  for  each category in the master taxonomy,  and  then  classify  objects  from the  source  taxonomy  into  these  categories.  in  this  paper  we attempt to use a powerful classification  method,  support  vector machine (svm), to attack  this  problem.  our  key  insight  is  that the availability  of  the  source  taxonomy  data  could  be  helpful  to build  better  classifiers  in  this  scenario,  therefore  it  would  be beneficial  to  do  transductive  learning  rather  than  inductive learning, i.e., learning to optimize  classification  performance  on a particular set of test examples. noticing that the categorizations of  the  master  and  source  taxonomies  often  have  some  semantic overlap, we propose a method, cluster shrinkage (cs), to further enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit knowledge. our  experiments  with  real-world  web  data  show  substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy integration.
