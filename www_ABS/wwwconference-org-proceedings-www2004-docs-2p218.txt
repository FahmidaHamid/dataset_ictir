it is a tedious and cumbersome process to update directly a wml document  for  the wireless web because its content composes of both data and presentation. thus, xml is used to handle the data while  its xslt stylesheet is used to extract and format the data for  presentation.  however,  different  stylesheets  have  to  be  used for different devices. an efficient and systematic method based on the idea of generating two separate sets of rules corresponding to content  extracting  and  formatting  parts  of  the  stylesheet  is described  in  this  paper.  the  data  extraction  part  is  constructed from  content  rules  while  the  formatting  part is constructed from presentation  rules.  they  are  then  combined  together  to  form  a stylesheet  by  an  xslt  generator.  a large number of stylesheets corresponding to different devices and a number of standard dtd documents  or  xml  schemas  can  be  generated  in  this  way  and stored  in  the  pool  during  application  setup  stage.  they  will  be individually selected from the pool by an xslt engine to produce different wml documents for different devices during run time. categories & subject descriptors d.1.1 [programming techniques] applicative programming.
