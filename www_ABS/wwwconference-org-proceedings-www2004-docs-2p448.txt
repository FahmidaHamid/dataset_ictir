web search is probably the single most important application on the internet. the most famous search techniques are perhaps the pagerank and hits algorithms. these algorithms are motivated by the observation that a hyperlink from a page to another is an implicit conveyance of authority to the target page. they exploit this  social  phenomenon identify  quality  pages,  e.g.,  authority  pages and  hub  pages. in this paper we argue that these  algorithms  miss  an  important  dimension  of the web, the temporal  dimension.  the  web  is  not  a  static  environment.  it changes constantly. quality pages in the past may not be quality pages now or in the future. these techniques favor older pages because these pages have many in-links accumulated over time. new  pages,  which  may  be  of  high  quality,  have few or no in-links  and  are  left  behind.  bringing  new  and  quality  pages  to users latest information.  research  publication  search  has  exactly  the  same problem. this paper studies the temporal dimension of search in the context of research publication search. we propose a number of  methods  deal  with  the  problem.  our  experimental  results show that these methods are highly effective. categories & subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval] information search and retrieval - search process, selection process.
