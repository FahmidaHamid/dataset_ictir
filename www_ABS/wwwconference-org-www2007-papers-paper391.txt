we present yago, a lightweight and extensible ontology with high coverage and quality. yago builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. this includes the is-a hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as haswonprize). the facts have been automatically extracted from wikipedia and uni ed with wordnet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. the resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond wordnet in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships   and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. yago is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with rdfs. finally, we show how yago can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.
