semantic search refers to a loose set of concepts, challenges and techniques having to do with harnessing the information of the growing web of data (wod) for web search. here we propose a formal model of one speci c semantic search task ad-hoc object retrieval. we show that this task provides a solid framework to study some of the semantic search problems currently tackled by commercial web search engines. we connect this task to the traditional ad-hoc document retrieval and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics. finally, we carry out a realistic evaluation of this task in the context of a web search application.
