semantic  web  is  challenged  by  the  uri  meaning  issues  arising from putting ontologies in open and distributed environments. as a try to clarify some of the meaning issues, this paper proposes a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies, it s built on the top of local models semantics, and extends it to deal with the uri  sharing  by  harmonizing  the  local  models  via  agreement  on vocabulary provenance. the commitment relationship is presented to  allow  the  uri  sharing  between  ontologies  with  richer semantics.
