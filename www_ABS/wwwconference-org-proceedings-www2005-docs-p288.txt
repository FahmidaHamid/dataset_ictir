semantic caching is an important technology for improving the response time of future user queries speci(cid12)ed over remote servers. this paper deals with the fundamental query containment problem in an xquery-based semantic caching system. to our best knowledge, the impact of subtle differences in xquery semantics caused by di(cid11)erent ways of specifying variables on query containment has not yet been studied. we introduce the concept of variable binding dependencies for representing the hierarchical element dependencies preserved by an xquery. we analyze the problem of xquery containment in the presence of such dependencies. we propose a containment mapping technique for nested xquery in presence of variable binding dependencies. the implication of the nested block structure on xquery containment is also considered. we mention the performance gains achieved by a semantic caching system we build based on the proposed technique.
