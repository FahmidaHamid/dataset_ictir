web  is  being  extensively  used  for  personal  expression,  which includes  ratings,  reviews,  recommendations,  blogs.  this  user created content, e.g. book review on amazon.com,  becomes  the property  of  the  website,  and  the  user  often  does  not  have  easy access to it. in some cases, user s feedback may get averaged with feedback from other users e.g. ratings of a video. we argue that the creator of such content needs to be able to retain (a link to) her created content. we introduce the concept of meb which is a user controlled store of such retained links.  a meb allows a user to access/share all the reviews she has given on different websites. with  this  capability  users  can  allow  their  friends  to  search through  their  feedback.  searching  through  one s  social  network allows  harnessing  the  power  of  social  networks  where  known relationships  provide  the  context  &  trust  necessary  to  interpret feedback.
