generic database replication algorithms do not scale linearly in throughput as all update, deletion and insertion (udi) queries must be applied to every database replica. the throughput is therefore limited to the point where the number of udi queries alone is su cient to overload one server. in such scenarios, partial replication of a database can help, as udi queries are executed only by a subset of all servers. in this paper we propose globetp, a system that employs partial replication to improve database throughput. glo-betp exploits the fact that a web application s query workload is composed of a small set of read and write templates. using knowledge of these templates and their respective execution costs, globetp provides database table placements that produce signi cant improvements in database throughput. we demonstrate the e ciency of this technique using two di erent industry standard benchmarks. in our experiments, globetp increases the throughput by 57% to 150% compared to full replication, while using identical hardware con guration. furthermore, adding a single query cache improves the throughput by another 30% to 60%.
