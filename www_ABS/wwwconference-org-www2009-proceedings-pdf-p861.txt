this  paper  presents end-user-oriented  programming environment  called  mashroom.  major  contributions  herein include an end-user programming model with an expressive data structure  as  well  as  a  set  of  formally-defined  mashup  operators. the data structure takes advantage of nested table, and maintains the  intuitiveness  while  allowing  users  to  express  complex  data objects.  the  mashup  operators  are  visualized  with  contextual menu  and  formula  bar  and  can  be  directly  applied  on  the  data. experiments  and  case  studies  reveal  that  end  users  have  little difficulty in effectively and efficiently using mashroom to build mashup applications.
