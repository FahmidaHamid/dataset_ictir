this paper presents a near real-time multilingual news monitoring and  analysis  system  that  forms  the  backbone  of  our  research work. the system integrates technologies to address the problems related  to  information  extraction  and  analysis  of  open  source intelligence  on  the  world  wide  web.  by  chaining  together different  techniques  in  text  mining,  automated  machine  learning and  statistical  analysis,  we  can  automatically  determine  who, where  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  what  is  being  reported  in  news articles.
