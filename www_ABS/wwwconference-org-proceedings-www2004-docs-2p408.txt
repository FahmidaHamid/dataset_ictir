this paper describes an xpath-based discourse analysis module for spoken  dialogue  systems  that  allows  the  dialogue  author  to  easily manipulate  and  query  both  the  user  input s  semantic representation and the dialogue context using a simple and compact formalism. we show that, in managing the human-machine interaction, the discourse context  and  the  dialogue  history  are  effectively  represented  as document object model (dom) structures. dom defines interfaces that  dialogue  scripts  can  use  to  dynamically  access  and  update  the content, the structure and the style of the documents. in general, this approach  applies  also to  richer  multimedia  and  multimodal interactions where the interpretation of the user input depends on a combination of input modalities. categories & subject descriptors i.2.1 [application and expert systems] natural language interfaces - i.2.7 [application and expert systems] speech recognition and synthesis
