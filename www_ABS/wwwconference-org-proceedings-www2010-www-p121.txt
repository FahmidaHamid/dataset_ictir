we introduce a client-server toolkit called sync kit that demonstrates how client-side database storage can improve the performance of data intensive websites. sync kit is designed to make use of the embedded relational database de ned in the upcoming html5 standard to o oad some data storage and processing from a web server onto the web browsers to which it serves content. our toolkit provides various strategies for synchronizing relational database tables between the browser and the web server, along with a client-side template library so that portions web applications may be executed client-side. unlike prior work in this area, sync kit persists both templates and data in the browser across web sessions, increasing the number of concurrent connections a server can handle by up to a factor of four versus that of a traditional server-only web stack and a factor of three versus a recent template caching approach.
