we propose a novel cost-efficient approach to threshold selection for  binary  webpage  classification  problems  with  imbalanced class  distributions.  in  many  binary-classification the distribution of classes is highly skewed. in such problems, using uniform  random  sampling  in  constructing  sample  sets  for threshold setting requires large sample sizes in order to include a statistically sufficient number of examples of the minority class. on the other hand, manually labeling examples is expensive and budgetary  considerations  require  that  the  size  of  sample  sets  be limited. these conflicting requirements make threshold selection a challenging problem. our method of sample-set construction is a novel approach based on stratified sampling, in which manually labeled  examples  are  expanded true  class distribution of the webpage population. our experimental results show  that  using  false  positive  rate  as  the  criterion  for  threshold setting  results  in  lower-variance  threshold  estimates  than  using other widely used accuracy measures such as f1 and precision.
