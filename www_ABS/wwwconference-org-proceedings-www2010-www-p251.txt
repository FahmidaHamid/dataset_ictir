we explore the use of the landing page content in sponsored search ad selection. speci cally, we compare the use of the ad s intrinsic content to augmenting the ad with the whole, or parts, of the landing page. we explore two types of ex-tractive summarization techniques to select useful regions from the landing pages out-of-context and in-context methods. out-of-context methods select salient regions from the landing page by analyzing the content alone, without taking into account the ad associated with the landing page. in-context methods use the ad context (including its title, creative, and bid phrases) to help identify regions of the landing page that should be used by the ad selection engine. in addition, we introduce a simple yet e ective unsupervised algorithm to enrich the ad context to further improve the ad selection. experimental evaluation con rms that the use of landing pages can signi cantly improve the quality of ad selection. we also  nd that our extractive summarization techniques reduce the size of landing pages substantially, while retaining or even improving the performance of ad retrieval over the method that utilize the entire landing page.
