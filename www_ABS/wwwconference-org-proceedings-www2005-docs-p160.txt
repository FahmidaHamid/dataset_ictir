we  present  an  approach  in  which  the  semantics  of  an  xml language  is defined by means of a transformation from an xml document  model  (an  xml  schema)  to  an  application  specific model.  the  application  specific  model  implements  the  intended behavior of documents written in the language. a transformation is  specified  in  a  model  transformation  language  used  in  the model  driven  architecture  (mda)  approach  for  software development. our approach provides a better separation of three concerns  found  in  xml  applications  syntax,  syntax  processing logic  and  intended  meaning of the syntax. it frees the developer of low-level syntactical details and improves the adaptability and reusability of xml applications. declarative transformation rules and  the  explicit  application  model  provide  a  finer  control  over the  application  parts  affected  by  adaptations.  transformation rules  and  the  application  model  for  an  xml  language  may  be composed  with  the  corresponding  rules  and  application  models defined  for  other  xml languages. in that way we achieve reuse and composition of xml applications.
