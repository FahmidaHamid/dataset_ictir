in this poster, based on our previous work in building a lightweight ddos (distributed denial-of-services) attacks detection mechanism for  web  server  using  tcm-knn  (transductive  confidence machines  for  k-nearest  neighbors)  and  genetic  algorithm  based instance selection methods, we further propose a more efficient and effective instance selection method, named e-fcm (extend fuzzy c-means).  by  using  this  method,  we  can  obtain  much  cheaper training  time  for  tcm-knn  while  ensuring  high  detection performance. therefore, the optimized mechanism is more suitable for lightweight ddos attacks detection in real network environment.
