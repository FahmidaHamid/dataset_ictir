this paper describes one solution to the problem of how to select sequence,  and  link  web  resources  into  a  coherent,  focused organization  for  instruction  that  addresses  a  user s  immediate  and focused  learning  need.  a  system  is  described  that  automatically generates  individualized  learning  paths  from  a repository of xml web  resources.  each  web resource has an xml learning object metadata  (lom)  description  consisting  of  general,  educational, and  classification  metadata.  dynamic  assembly  of  these  learning objects is based on the relative match of the learning object content and  metadata  to  the  learner s  needs,  preferences,  context,  and constraints.  learning  objects  are  connected  into  coherent  paths based on their lom topic classifications and the proximity of these topics  in  a  resource  description  framework  (rdf)  graph.  an instructional sequencing policy specifies how to arrange the objects on the path into a particular learning sequence. the system has been deployed and evaluated within a corporate setting.
