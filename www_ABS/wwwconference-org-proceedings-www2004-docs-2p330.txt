in this paper, we propose a framework called cc-buddy, for maintaining dynamic data coherency in peer-to-peer environment. working on the basis of peer heterogeneity in data coherency requirement, peers in cc-buddy cooperate with each other to disseminate the updates by pushing. simulation results show that our solution not only improves the  delity in data, but also reduces the workload of servers, therefore achieves high-scalability.
