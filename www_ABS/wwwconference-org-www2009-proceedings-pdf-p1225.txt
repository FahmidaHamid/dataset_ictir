over  the  last  few  years,  blogs  (web  logs)  have  gained  massive popularity  and  have  become  one  of  the  most  influential  web social media in our times. every blog post in the blogosphere has a  well  defined  timestamp,  which  is  not  taken  into  account  by search engines. by conducting research regarding this feature of the  blogosphere,  we  can  attempt  to  discover  bursty  terms  and correlations  between  them  during  a  time  interval.  we  apply kleinberg s  automaton  on  extracted  titles  of  blog  posts  to discover  bursty  terms,  we  introduce  a  novel  representation  of  a term s burstiness evolution called  state series and we employ a euclidean-based distance metric to discover potential correlations between  terms  without  taking  into  account  their  context.  we evaluate  the  results  trying  to  match  them  with  real  life  events. finally, we propose some ideas for further evaluation techniques and future research in the field.
