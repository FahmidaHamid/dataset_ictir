nowadays, the increasing amount of semantic data available on the web leads to a new stage in the potential of semantic web applications. however, it also introduces new issues due to the heterogeneity of the available semantic resources. one of the most remarkable is redundancy, that is, the excess of di erent semantic descriptions, coming from di erent sources, to describe the same intended meaning. in this paper, we propose a technique to perform a large scale integration of senses (expressed as ontology terms), in order to cluster the most similar ones, when indexing large amounts of online semantic information. it can dramatically reduce the redundancy problem on the current semantic web. in order to make this objective feasible, we have studied the adaptability and scalability of our previous work on sense integration, to be translated to the much larger scenario of the semantic web. our evaluation shows a good behaviour of these techniques when used in large scale experiments, then making feasible the proposed approach.
