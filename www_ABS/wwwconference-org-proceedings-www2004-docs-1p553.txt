the  world  wide  web  is  emerging  not  only  as  an  infrastructure for  data,  but  also  for  a  broader  variety  of  resources  that  are increasingly  being  made  available  as  web  services.  relevant current  standards  like  uddi,  wsdl,  and  soap  are  in  their fledgling  years  and  form  the  basis  of  making  web  services  a workable and broadly adopted technology. however, realizing the fuller scope of the promise of web services and associated service oriented architecture will requite further technological advances in the  areas  of  service  interoperation,  service  discovery,  service composition,  and  process  orchestration.  semantics,  especially  as supported  by  the  use  of  ontologies,  and  related  semantic  web technologies, are likely to provide better qualitative and scalable solutions  to  these  requirements.  just  as  semantic  annotation  of data in the semantic web is the first critical step to better search, integration  and  analytics  over  heterogeneous  data,  semantic annotation  of  web  services  is  an  equally  critical  first  step  to achieving  the  above  promise.  our  approach  is  to  work  with existing web services technologies and combine them with ideas from  the  semantic  web  to  create  a  better  framework  for  web service  discovery  and  composition. this  paper  we present mwsaf (meteors  web  service  annotation framework), a framework for semi-automatically marking up web service  descriptions  with  ontologies.  we  have  developed algorithms  to  match  and  annotate  wsdl  files  with  relevant ontologies. we use domain ontologies to categorize web services into domains. an empirical study of our approach is presented to help evaluate its performance.
