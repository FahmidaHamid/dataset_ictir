an important obstacle to the success of the semantic web is that the  establishment  of  the  semantic  relationship  is  labor-intensive. this  paper  proposes  an  automatic  semantic relationship discovering approach for constructing the semantic link network. the basic premise of this work is that the semantics of a web page can  be  reflected  by  a  set  of  keywords,  and  the  semantic relationship  between  two  web  pages  can  be  determined  by  the semantic  relationship  between  their  keyword  sets.  the  approach adopts  the  data  mining  algorithms  to  discover  the  semantic relationships between keyword sets, and then uses deductive and analogical  reasoning  to  enrich  the  semantic  relationships.  the proposed  algorithms  have  been  implemented.  experiment  shows that the approach is feasible. categories  &  subject  descriptors  h.3.1 [information  storage  and  retrieval]  content  analysis  and indexing   indexing methods, linguistic processing.
