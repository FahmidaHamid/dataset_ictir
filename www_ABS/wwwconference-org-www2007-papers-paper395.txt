requirement  engineering  (re)  is  emerging  as  an  increasingly important discipline for supporting web application development, as  these  are  designed  to  satisfy  diverse  stakeholder  needs, additional  functional,  information,  multimedia  and  usability requirements  as  compared  to  traditional  software  applications. moreover, when considering innovative e-commerce applications, value-based  re  is  an  extremely  relevant  methodology  which exploits the concept of economic value during the re activity. in contrast, most of the methodologies proposed for the development of  web  applications,  primarily  focus  on  the  system  design,  and paying  less  attention  to  the  re,  and  specifically  to  value-based re. focusing this aspect, the paper presents integration of value-based re models to webml models using our recently proposed vip  business  modeling  framework   [1].  we  also  analyze  the framework s potential in linking other modeling approaches, and argue  about  its  significant  integration  potential  with  various  e-r/oo-based, process aware web modeling approaches.
