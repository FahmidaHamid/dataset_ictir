with the advent of web 2.0 technologies, websites have evolved from static pages to dynamic, interactive web-based applications with  the  ability  to  replicate  common  desktop  functionality. however,  for  blind  and  visually  impaired  individuals  who  rely upon screen readers, web 2.0 applications force them to adapt to an  inaccessible  use  model.  many  technologies,  including  wai-aria,  ajax,  and  improved  screen  reader  support,  are  rapidly evolving  to  improve  this  situation.  however,  simply  combining them  does  not  solve  the  problems  of  screen  reader  users.    the main contributions of this paper are two models of interaction for screen  reader  users,  for  both  traditional  websites  and  web  2.0 applications.   further  contributions  are  a  discussion  of accessibility  difficulties  screen  reader  users  encounter  when interacting  with  web  2.0  applications,  a  user  workflow  design model  for  improving  web  2.0  accessibility,  and  a  set  of  design requirements for developers to ease the user's burden and increase accessibility.  these models, accessibility difficulties, and design implications  are  based  directly  on  responses  and  lessons  learned from  usability  research  focusing  on  web  2.0  usage  and  screen reader users.  without the conscious effort of web engineers and designers, most blind and visually impaired users will shy away from  using  new  web  2.0  technology  in  favor  of  desktop  based applications.
