due  to  the  lexical  gap  between  questions  and  answers,  automatically  detecting  right  answers  becomes  very  challenging  for  community  question-answering  sites.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  an analogical  reasoning-based  method.  it  treats  questions  and  answers  as  relational  data  and  ranks  an  answer  by  measuring  the analogy of its link to a query with the links embedded in previous relevant  knowledge;  the  answer  that  links  in  the  most  analogous way  to  the  new  question  is  assumed  to  be  the  best  answer.  we based  our  experiments  on  29.8  million  yahoo!answer  question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of the approach.
