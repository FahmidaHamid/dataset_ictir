social annotation has gained increasing popularity in many web-based applications, leading to an emerging research area in text analysis and information retrieval. this paper is concerned with developing probabilistic models and computational algorithms for social annotations. we propose a uni ed framework to combine the modeling of social annotations with the language modeling-based methods for information retrieval. the proposed approach consists of two steps (1) discovering topics in the contents and annotations of documents while categorizing the users by domains; and (2) enhancing document and query language models by incorporating user domain interests as well as topical background models. in particular, we propose a new general generative model for social annotations, which is then sim-pli ed to a computationally tractable hierarchical bayesian network. then we apply smoothing techniques in a risk minimization framework to incorporate the topical information to language models. experiments are carried out on a real-world annotation data set sampled from del.icio.us. our results demonstrate signi cant improvements over traditional approaches.
