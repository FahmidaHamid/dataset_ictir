the meaning of names (uri references) is a contentious issue in the semantic web. numerous proposals have been given for how to provide meaning for names in the semantic web, ranging from a strict localized model-theoretic semantics to proposals for a uni(cid2)ed single meaning. we argue that a slight expansion of the standard model-theoretic semantics for names is suf(cid2)cient for the present, and can easily be augmented where necessary to allow communities of interest to strengthen this spartan theory of meaning.
