web  information  systems  (wis)  support  the  process  of retrieving  information  from  sources  on  the  web  and  of presenting them as a hypermedia presentation. most wis design methodologies  focus  on the  abstract navigation  (hyperlinks).  the  actual  presentation  generation  is less supported. hera is one of the few wis methodologies that offer  a  tool  for  presentation  generation  (hpg).  the  hpg transforms rdf data obtained as the result of a query into a web presentation suited to the user (in html or wml).
