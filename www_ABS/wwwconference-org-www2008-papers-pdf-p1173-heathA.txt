searchers have a choice about which web search engine they use when looking for information online.  if they are unsuccessful on one  engine,  users  may  switch  to  a  different  engine  to  continue their search.  by predicting when switches are likely to occur, the search experience can be modified to retain searchers or ensure a quality  experience  for  incoming  searchers.    in  this  poster,  we present  research  on  a  technique  for  predicting  search  engine switches.    our  findings  show  that  prediction  is  possible  at  a reasonable level of accuracy, particularly when personalization or user grouping is employed.  these findings have implications for the  design  of  applications  to  support  more  effective  online searching.
