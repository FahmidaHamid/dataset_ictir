image spam is a new obfuscating method which spammers invented to more effectively bypass conventional text based spam filters. in this paper, we extract local invariant features of images and run a one-class svm classifier which uses the pyramid match kernel as the  kernel  function  to  detect  image  spam.  experimental  results demonstrate that our algorithm is effective for fighting image spam.
