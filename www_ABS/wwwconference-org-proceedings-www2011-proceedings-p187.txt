a drive-by download attack occurs when a user visits a webpage which attempts to automatically download malware without the user s consent. attackers sometimes use a malware distribution network (mdn) to manage a large number of malicious webpages, exploits, and malware exe-cutables. in this paper, we provide a new method to determine these mdns from the secondary urls and redirect chains recorded by a high-interaction client honeypot. in addition, we propose a novel drive-by download detection method. instead of depending on the malicious content used by previous methods, our algorithm  rst identi es and then leverages the urls of the mdn s central servers, where a central server is a common server shared by a large percentage of the drive-by download attacks in the same mdn. a set of regular expression-based signatures are then generated based on the urls of each central server. this method allows additional malicious webpages to be identi ed which launched but failed to execute a successful drive-by download attack. the new drive-by detection system named arrow has been implemented, and we provide a large-scale evaluation on the output of a production drive-by detection system. the experimental results demonstrate the e ective-ness of our method, where the detection coverage has been boosted by 96% with an extremely low false positive rate.
