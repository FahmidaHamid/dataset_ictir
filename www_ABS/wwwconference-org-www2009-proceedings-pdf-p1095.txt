this paper proposes an e cient relevance feedback based interactive model for keyword generation in sponsored search advertising. we formulate the ranking of relevant terms as a supervised learning problem and suggest new terms for the seed by leveraging user relevance feedback information. active learning is employed to select the most informative samples from a set of candidate terms for user labeling. experiments show our approach improves the relevance of generated terms signi cantly with little user e ort required.
