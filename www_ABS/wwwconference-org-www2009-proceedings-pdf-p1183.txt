uploading  tourist  photos  is  a  popular  activity  on  photo  sharing platforms. these photographs and their associated metadata (tags, geo-tags,  and  temporal  information)  should  be  useful  for  mining information  about  the  sites  visited.  however,  user-supplied metadata  are  often  noisy  and  efficient  filtering  methods  are needed  before  extracting  useful  knowledge.  we  focus  here  on exploiting  temporal  information, associated with tourist sites that appear  in  flickr.  from  automatically  filtered  sets  of  geo-tagged photos,  we  deduce  answers  to  questions  like   how  long  does  it take to visit a tourist attraction?  or  what can i visit in one day in this  city?   our  method  is  evaluated  and  validated  by  comparing the  automatically  obtained  visit  duration  times  to  manual estimations.
