online curriculum portals aim to support networks of instructors and  learners by providing a space of convergence for enhancing peer-to-peer individuals  of  an educational institution. to this end, effective, open and scalable e-learning  systems  are  required  to  acquire,  store,  and  share knowledge under the form of learning objects (lo). in this paper, we  are  interested  in  exploiting  the  semantic  relationships  that characterize  these  los  (e.g.,  prerequisite,  part-of  or  see-also)  in order  to  capture  and  access  individual  and  group  knowledge  in conjunction with the learning processes supported by educational institutions.  to  achieve  this  functionality,  semantic  web  (e.g., rdf/s) and declarative query languages (e.g., rql) are employed to represent los and their relationships (e.g., lom), as well as, to support  navigation  at  the  conceptual  e-learning  portal  space.  in this way, different los could be presented to the same learners, according to the traversed schema navigation paths (i.e., learning paths).  using  the  apache  jetspeed  framework  we  are  able  to generate  and  assemble  at  run-time  portlets  (i.e.,  pluggable  web components)  for  visualizing  personalized  views  as  dynamic web pages. last but not least, both learners and instructors can employ the same portal gui for updating semantically described los and thus support an open-ended continuum of learning. to the best of our knowledge, the work presented in this paper is the first online curriculum  portal  platform  supporting the  aforementioned functionality.
