regression testing assures the quality of modified service-oriented business  applications  against  unintended  changes.  however,  a typical regression test suite is large in size. earlier execution of those test  cases  that  may  detect  failures  is  attractive.  many  existing prioritization techniques order test cases according to their respective coverage  of  program  statements  in  a  previous  version  of  the application. on the other hand, industrial service-oriented business applications are typically written in orchestration languages such as ws-bpel and integrated with workflow steps and web services via xpath and wsdl. faults in these artifacts may cause the application to extract wrong data from messages, leading to failures in service compositions.  surprisingly,  current  regression  testing  research hardly considers these artifacts. we propose a multilevel coverage model to capture the business process, xpath, and wsdl from the perspective of regression testing. we develop a family of test case prioritization techniques atop the model. empirical results show that our  techniques  can  achieve  significantly  higher  rates  of  fault detection than existing techniques.
