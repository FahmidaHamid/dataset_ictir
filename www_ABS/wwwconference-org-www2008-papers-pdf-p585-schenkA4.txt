easy reuse and integration of declaratively described information in a distributed setting is one of the main motivations for building the semantic web. despite of this claim, reuse and recombination of rdf data today is mostly done using data replication and procedural code. a simple declarative mechanism for reusing and combining rdf data would help users to generate content for the semantic web. having such a mechanism, the semantic web could better bene t from user generated content, as it is broadly present in the so called web 2.0, but also from better linkage of existing content. we propose networked graphs, which allow users to de ne rdf graphs both, by extensionally listing content, but also by using views on other graphs. these views can be used to include parts of other graphs, to transform data before including it and to denote rules. the relationships between graphs are described declaratively using sparql queries and an extension of the sparql semantics. networked graphs are easily exchangeable between and interpretable on di erent computers. using existing protocols, networked graphss can be evaluated in a distributed setting.
