in  this  paper,  we  study  the  problem  of  online  spelling  correction for  query  completions.  misspelling  is  a  common  phenomenon among  search  engines  queries.  in  order  to  help  users  effectively express  their  information  needs,  mechanisms  for  automatically correcting  misspelled  queries  are  required.  online  spelling correction aims to provide spell corrected completion suggestions as  a  query  is  incrementally  entered.  as  latency  is  crucial  to  the utility of the suggestions, such an algorithm needs to be not only accurate, but also efficient. to tackle this problem, we propose and study a generative model for  input  queries,  based  on  a  noisy  channel transformation of  the intended  queries.  utilizing  spelling  correction  pairs,  we  train  a markov  n-gram  transformation  model  that  captures  user  spelling behavior  in  an  unsupervised  fashion.  to  find  the  top  spell-corrected  completion  suggestions  in  real-time,  we  adapt  the  a* search  algorithm  with  various  pruning  heuristics  to  dynamically expand  the  search  space  efficiently.  evaluation  of  the  proposed methods  demonstrates  a  substantial  increase  in  the  effectiveness of online spelling correction over existing techniques.
