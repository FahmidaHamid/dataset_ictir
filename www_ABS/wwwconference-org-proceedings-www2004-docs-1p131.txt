an increasingly large amount of such applications employ service objects  such  as  servlets  to  generate  dynamic  and  personalized content.  existing  caching  infrastructures  are  not  well  suited  for caching  such  content in  mobile  environments  because  of disconnection and weak connection. one possible approach to this problem  is  to  replicate  web-related  application  logic  to  client devices.  the  challenges  to  this  approach  are  to  deal  with  client devices  that  exhibit  huge  divergence  in  resource  availabilities,  to support  applications that  have  different  data  sharing  and coherency requirements, and to accommodate the same application under different deployment environments. the replet system targets these challenges. it uses client, server and  application  capability  and  preference  information  (cpi)  to direct the replication of service objects to client devices from the selection of a device for replication and populating the device with client-specific data, to choosing an appropriate replica to serve a given request and maintaining the desired state consistency among replicas.  the  replet  system  exploits  on-device  replication  to enable  client,  server  and  application-specific  cost  metrics  for replica  invocation  and  synchronization.  we  have  implemented  a prototype in the context of servlet-based web applications. our experiment  and  simulation  results  demonstrate  the  viability  and significant  benefits  of  cpi-driven  on-device  service  object replication.
