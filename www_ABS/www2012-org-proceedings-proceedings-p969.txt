web service composition provides a means of customized and  exible integration of service functionalities. quality-of-service (qos) optimization algorithms select services in order to adapt work ows to the nonfunctional requirements of the user. with increasing number of services in a work ow, previous approaches fail to achieve a su cient reliability. moreover, expensive ad-hoc replanning is required to deal with service failures. the major problem with such sequential application of planning and replanning is that it ignores the potential costs during the initial planning and they consequently are hidden from the decision maker. our basic idea to overcome this substantial problem is to compute a qos optimized selection of service clusters that includes a su cient number of backup services for each service employed. to support the human decision maker in the service selection task, our approach considers the possible repair costs directly in the initial composition. on the basis of a multi-objective approach and using a suitable service selection interface, the decision maker can select compositions in line with his/her personal risk preferences.
