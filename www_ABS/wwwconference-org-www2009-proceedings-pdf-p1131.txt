in  the  past,  some  researches  suggested  that  engineers  can  use combined  software  reliability  growth  models  (srgms)  to  obtain more  accurate  reliability  prediction  during  testing.  in  this  paper, three  weighted  combinational  models,  namely,  equal,  linear,  and nonlinear  weight,  are  proposed  for  reliability  estimation  of web-based software. we further investigate the estimation accuracy of using genetic algorithm to determine the weight assignment for the proposed models. preliminary result shows that the linearly and nonlinearly weighted combinational models have better prediction capability than single srgm and equally weighted combinational model for web-based software.
