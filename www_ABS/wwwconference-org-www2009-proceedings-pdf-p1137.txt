in  this  paper,  we  describe  the  fully  dynamic  semantic  portal  we implemented, integrating semantic web technologies and service oriented architecture (soa). the goals of the portal are twofold first it helps administrators to easily propose new features in the portal using semantics to ease the orchestration process; secondly it  automatically  generates  a  customized  user  interface  for  these scenarios. this user interface takes into account different devices and  assists  end-users  in  the  use  of  the  portal  taking  benefit  of context awareness. all the added-value of this portal is based on a core semantics defined by an ontology. we present here the main features of this portal and how it was implemented using state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks.
